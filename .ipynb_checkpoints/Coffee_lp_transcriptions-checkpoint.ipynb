       "\" CryptoZoo.co. I am so excited about this project. It's so fun. It's a really fun game that makes you money. A fun game that earns you money. How much did you guys make from CryptoZoo? I lost around $50,000 in CryptoZoo. I lost $40,000. I lost around $15,000 in US dollars. I lost $25,000. $120,000. $500,000 is Australian, which is half a million in CryptoZoo. Shut up! No, you haven't! Yeah, 500K. Oh, no. Today we're investigating Logan Paul's CryptoZoo, a blockchain game that made millions but never worked. Some of you guys think you know the story, but it goes so much deeper. I've uncovered sociopaths, billionaires, fake orphans that I mention fake orphans and of course at the center of it we have Logan Paul himself who has abandoned this thing, leaving thousands of fake orphans in his wake. Wait a second. Thousands of victims in his wake. Now you'll be hearing from some of those people because their stories are heartbreaking. This is the first in a three-part series that's been a year in the making. And if you like high effort investigations like this one, please consider supporting this channel on Patreon. I don't take sponsors, we are viewer supported, so if you want to and are able to, thank you. Either way, enjoy the video. For the last six months I've been working on my own NFT project. We have a massive team behind it and are probably out of pocket, like a million, just because we believe it's going to work. September 1st, CryptoZoo.co We don't scam. I've never scammed anyone before. Logan cares extremely deeply about his audience, loves his audience, loves his brand, doesn't have to scam to make money. Welcome to part one, the million dollar mystery that began this whole story. Like many people, I first heard about CryptoZoo from a podcast Logan runs called Impulsant, which was the experience of a lot of people that I spoke to. So I first heard about it on the Logan called Podcast. Impulsant I think. It was a fee, it was one of the impressive episodes. The thing that I'm most excited for, and this is the first time I've ever said anything about this. For the last six months I've been working on my own NFT project. I think there needs to be a fresh take. And this project that I have, is that fresh take? Now look, at first I was just as surprised that this pitch is anyone else, because I just got finished roasting Logan for a different coin called DinkDunk, which his fans lost money on. I'm a big, big fan. I've never seen it, that's why I'm all in. It's comedic, it's fun, it's comedy. Now look, I know Logan's friends tried to make it look like DinkDunk was all about the memes, but it turns out they secretly were tied to the project, and Logan created the DinkDunk character himself, and subsequently abandoned that project. So if you invested in it, you got blasted, and Logan rightfully took a lot of heat for DinkDunk, which is why I was surprised when he seemingly immediately jumped into another crypto project. But Logan insisted CryptoZoo, it was different. It wasn't his friend's project this time, it was his, and it wasn't even a project at all. It was a game that could earn you money. I'm excited to watch my game. You keep using it, and you just did it again. You keep using a word there, game. You're not using like a project, it's a game. It's a game. It's a fun, it's a really fun game that makes you money. Now you might be wondering, how is it possible to earn money from a game? Well, let me try to break it down for you. This is how it was supposed to work. You started by buying this crypto token called Zoo, which is their in-game currency, and you use Zoocoins to then buy egg NFTs, which you can then hatch to become animals. You then can breed those two animals to become hybrid animals. For example, if you breed a gorilla and a kitten, you get a gorkity. And the more rare the NFT, the higher the daily yield of zoo tokens that animal earns you every day. Theoretically, it works like almost like passive income. You can then burn your animal NFTs to release the zoo they earned back to you, and from there you can invest it into eggs or just cash out. Now, some of you of the Egyptian persuasion might notice some triangular qualities to this game description. But let's not be too quick to judge, because remember, there are a lot of NFT games built on this model. It's called Play to Earn. Now, Logan admits that there are other games like his, but what's going to really make his stand out is that other games have randomly generated assets. His game has handmade art. It's quick to make a digital asset with, you know, unique, randomly generated characteristics. We can made art for the past six months, bro. Approved very specific notes, ten different artists making art for our project. Now, I'll admit, this all sounds very enticing. Handmade art, a fun game that can earn you money, and one of the biggest influencers in the world backing it. You might think, how can I lose? Which is why when people were told all you had to do to play was buy an egg, people spent millions. Just on the first launch between ETH and Zoo, people bought 2.5 million dollars worth of eggs in the first day. And did I mention the game hadn't even been launched yet? All people were buying was the marketing and the promises. And it wasn't just the NFTs they bought either. The Zoo token also skyrocketed in value, reaching a $2 billion market cap pre-game launch, right? The trading volume was in the tens of millions of dollars per day. Which kind of is like Fortnite not coming out, but people trading tens of millions of dollars in V-bucks every day? That's what this was like. And I know it sounds stupid to buy an influencer project, but you have to understand people saw Logan as different. It was Logan Paul at the end of the day. An internet personality that I actually trusted, that I actually kind of believed in. Obviously when someone saw influential releases something, everyone wants to be a part of it. I still believe in this first fight with everyone else that I believe in that. Logan pulls a change man. I thought it was a safe place having a guy like that identified like Logan Paul being the head of the project. They had seen this story he had been telling everyone that he was this reformed influencer, right? That he was no longer a reckless clout goblin just in it for the money. They thought this time it's different. Logan Paul couldn't possibly scam us, right? But as the game got closer to release, the Crypto Zoo team started releasing the first ever photos of these animals. And come to find out this handmade art story wasn't really true. It was actually Adobe Stock Photos mashed together. This was the sort of first red flag of this project. And I made a video about it at the time, but it was kind of surface level. And something didn't add up beneath the surface, something where I just couldn't shut this case down in my head. It was actually part of the announcement video that they, something they said. See if you can spot it. We have a massive team behind it and are probably out of pocket. Like a million just because we believe it's going to work on development. Yeah, that's the line that started this whole mystery. We spent a million dollars on development. I couldn't get this out of my head. You know, is he lying? There's no way he expects people to believe he's spent it on art. So wait, maybe he's spent it on blockchain stuff, right? That's what I thought. But then I audited the smart contract. And it's not handmade at all. It's not even original. It's what's called a fork, a copy of, you know, some other code that exists out there. One of them is called floaty shib X, which launched before it. So where did this million dollars go? I didn't understand. And Logan just kept repeating this claim. We put hundreds of thousands of dollars in it. Personally, the whole team, a million plus. Now at the time I'm looking into this, there's a teaser going around for hatch day, which is the day you can hatch your egg in FTs. And it kind of symbolized the true launch of crypto. So I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe this is where they spent all the money on their game. Even their community manager, Ben Roth promised people after hatch day, things will take a turn for the 180. So I put Ben Roth in the board too. I needed to know all the characters in crypto zoo. And I waited. And finally, on November 3rd, 2021, Ben Roth turned out to be right. Things did take a turn on hatch day. Only for the worse. Let's meet one of the victims, helicopter Bob, to explain more. My name is Rob, helicopter Bob lost just under $7,000 with crypto zoo. When the first thing I asked Bob was about his animals. If he was making money with crypto zoo, how much he made and if the passive yield worked. Oh, I'd never did from the beginning. There wasn't even written into the contract where it showed that you could, that you were actually yielding with you. But there was nothing that was actually backing that up. There was no way to claim your yield. There never was. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Play that again. Did you hear that? There was no way to claim your yield. There never was. Hold on. The core mechanic of crypto zoo that you can make money with these stupid animals didn't even work on launch day. And still, to this day, a year later, still does not work is what the investors are saying. Which this is just crazy. People spent millions of dollars on these eggs. But it even gets worse because I kept talking to people and I discovered something. Because remember I told you you could buy eggs with those zoo coins? Well, apparently they also made it so you could buy them with Ethereum. And on the day of selling, about half of these purchases took place with Ethereum. Only it turns out for the people who spent ETH. Not only did the yield part of it not work, did the NFTs not pay you, you also couldn't even hatch them. So I acquired a bunch of eggs. And I actually want to play the game. I didn't acquire the eggs with the intent of keeping them. I actually wanted to hatch them and see what I got out of them and play in this ecosystem that's been advertised or whatever. And then I can't do anything. It's not showing up on the website when I connect my wallet, etc., etc. Some old baffle I'm like, is... I must be doing something wrong. So I open up a support ticket. I open up a support ticket. The crypto zoom bin is actually the person answering my support ticket. Oh yeah, no, no, it's down for the moment, but we're working on it. Let me tell you, it's never been out. Wait, you can't even hatch? No, I'm telling you, it's just a picture. There's nothing I could do with it. You're kidding! You can't hatch? Nothing I could do with it. You can ask any of those community, you guys. It's basically worth nothing whatsoever. Wow, so on launch date, basically nothing worked. And a year later, that's still true. Now, after this was discovered, the price of Zoo fell 63% in just 24 hours. And at this point, Logan Paul basically goes silent on crypto zoom. No more podcast mentions. No more saying he hand made art. Crypto Zoo already got millions in investments, but Logan only speaks in the discord twice over the next year. To say, quote, sober, currently shaking my head. And, yo, that was his contribution to this project. Meanwhile, his community manager, Ben Roth, was actively claiming that Logan was going to be marketing crypto zoo any day now. He told people things like, Logan is an uncontrollable marketing guru. It's over when we launch. And when we have a product to market, it'll get marketed. And marketing will crush. I promise you. And this disconnect between Logan abandoning the project and his team on crypto zoo saying that he hadn't saying that it was going to be any day now. Left investors feeling like they were being led on. What he had to do was go and tell us that there's something going on with this project. I'm abandoning it or whatever before people go on the track and promising and promising. Yeah, it's going to be great. But when it came to actually doing anything, he just hit away from it. How some decency to come out talk to the people that invested initially, that invested along the way on all of the fake and false promises, on all of the false hype and be honest with people. Because surely Logan Paul, who's got this billion dollar hydration company and WWE star, is got enough money. It doesn't need to to rook as much. And it's because of these false promises about marketing, that these poor investors believed in crypto zoo so long they sat, and watched every Logan ball up as a trying to guess and decipher when this so-called marketing push would happen. And Logan and his team really fed into this with a lot of cryptic messages. Only a month after crypto zoo's launch, actually, the hatch day, they started teasing this. Not too much of this is out, but he's been working on a massive project. And the one of them will be the biggest thing I ever do. It's like my life and soul is locked into this project. Which is where most of my time these days goes. Wow, surely this secret project that Logan put his soul into is crypto zoo, right? You know, the project he launched a month ago? Well, his fans certainly thought so. And like holy cow makes so much sense. He's talking about crypto zoo. Ben and the dudes are like putting smiley faces and egging the rest of the community like this is it guys. You know, this is what we're working towards. I mean, this is it. It's finally happening. Logan's going to market the project and they kept saying that Logan's going to market the project and it's going to change everything. So now imagine their surprise when another clip services of Logan finally admitting this secret project isn't crypto zoo at all. It's something else entirely. I'll tell you about this project when we get closer to launch this project. Why is this going to be? Is that the thing with the egg? No, no, no, no. Okay, this one. This is going to be, yeah, this is going to be crazy. They're done. Oh, man, can you imagine if you're one of these investors? And Logan Paul's going pitching this new secret project and you're thinking it's crypto zoo. And someone's like, oh, is it that is it that thing with the eggs? And he's like, no, no, no, no, definitely, definitely not. That was the last project. This is the real project that I'm working on. Thankfully, people didn't just let this slide because as he went around making the rounds on his new project called 99 originals, people were like, hey, didn't you just abandon your last one? And unsurprisingly, it's not his fault. It's the bad actors who ruined the project. Because I say people giving multiple explanations for why these haven't worked. And you know there's accusations out there. How does it make you feel when people are doing these takedown videos about your MFT projects previously? It's sad because of what I just said. There's so much going on behind the scenes like, talk, I'm not the f***ing bad guy here. Yeah, yeah. There's some actual f***ers out there. And it's not me. Like I'm here to build. This is a space where a lot of people do see dollar signs. Like any burgeoning industry, if there's money to be made, there's going to be both good and bad people. There's a lot of shaped characters in the crypto space. I'm learning all of it. We had a f***ing issue with crypto zoo where our lead developer took the code that he made, fled Switzerland, actually fled Switzerland and held it hostage for a million dollars. Like behind the scenes drama that took a stick and stuck it in the spokes of my wheels. Oh, well, that wasn't expected. There's a shady developer who held up Logan's code hostage in Switzerland. That's why this hasn't worked the whole time. He held it hostage for a million dollars. Well, let's add that to the board. I mean, isn't the mystery solved? Now, obviously, the first thing I wanted to do was hunt down this developer who will be calling Z here and find out the truth of what happened. Why did he steal Logan's code for a million dollars? However, I finally got a hold of him and when I did, he admitted he took the code hostage but he says the reason for it was nothing like what Logan had said. You never really never gave me anything. I don't have everything. And you've got to point what I was working on and what I just realized was that I was trying to steal all of my work. I mean, so I said, oh, this works so well. And I kind of like, you said like a mom just ran into the kitchen. And I did something to get out where I was buying a page of my own. On my end, I had seen the 30 engineers like earning $50,000 a week on building this thing. And the only thing they brought today was the first stop. So Z claims he wasn't blackmailing anyone. He had to hire a team to develop this whole thing and he just wanted to be paid for the work they did. According to him, they negotiated a $1 million payday for this whole project. And from the second I heard that, oh, that's interesting because Logan claims he spent $1 million on this whole thing. And this developer saying he's owed $1 million on this project. Now, I didn't want to just take one person's word for it. So I later confirmed with another developer who worked for something called the Blockchain Center that he also hadn't been paid. We've been paid nothing. I would have loved to have zoo, but I don't have any. So that's multiple sources working on the crypto zoo team project who were not paid. Now, obviously, these are big accusations, which is why I wanted to confront Logan Paul on them. Unfortunately, we're not exactly on speaking terms. So I wondered, how could I speak to Logan without speaking to Logan? And that's when I found out there was someone who might know just as much about this whole story. And I will explain everything one day with my manager who's like in charge now. Logan Paul's manager, a guy named Jeff Levin. He might be just what we need to settle this whole thing. So I gave him a call. Hello. Hey, Jeff. Hey, sorry to bother you. This is Steven with Coffee Zilla. I'm calling because I've heard reports that crypto zoo hasn't paid their development team. And I'm just reaching out for comment before I do this story. I got your number from one of the development team and they just wanted to I just want to follow up on that. I have no comment for it. Okay, you're are you guys denying it? Are you saying it's not true? No comment. I don't think that the information is true. Okay, because they're saying a million dollars hasn't been paid in development for crypto zoo. I said publicly that it has been paid. So I mean, it's pretty serious accusation. And obviously I don't want to just run a story. If you guys have a whole side story here, your job, your job as a, as someone that is reporting news is to actually verify correct news. Right. That's why I'm calling you. And that's legal grounds for that stuff. So I'm just telling you legally, you have to report correct news with a verifiable information. Right. That's why I'm calling you. They've given me a lot of things. A lot of evidence. Okay. Well, okay. You can you can have the evidence you want, but I'm just letting you know if you report anything on us. I appreciate your business. I appreciate you as a person. And I'm just telling you, you know, from legal standpoint. As we've been advised always is if anybody reports fake news. That's where we won't, you know, yeah, this call was a mess. Jeff Logan's manager seems to be implying that I'm not allowed to repeat allegations his own development team made. Even though Logan can go on podcasts and publicly accuse those developers of stealing his coat. Not only that, he's the one who refuses to provide any evidence, but seems to sort of be implying that maybe we'll sue you if you tell this to anyone. Which he then denies doing when I ask him if that's what he's doing. Told you I'm no comment to it telling you once again from a legal standpoint, you have to report truth. If you do not verify truth, then you're just allegations. And those then will be handled the way that we want to handle. Wait, so you're saying you're saying you refuse to give me proof that the allegations aren't true. But if I report on the allegations, you guys might sue. No, no, I did not say that. I did not say that. I'm just I'm trying to read between the lines. Don't read between the lines. Okay. Listen to the words that I'm saying. Okay. Because I'm saying I'm listening. I have no comment on the situation. Your job legally is to report facts. If you don't report facts on the information you're given, it is illegal. Yes, that was a real conversation with a real person. Now, I'm no lawyer, but I don't think it's a crime to say that multiple developers say they haven't been paid. And Logan's team refuses to provide any evidence or like statements or wire transfers that they have. Which, by the way, seems incredibly ironic, given just how much Logan winds about not being paid by Floyd Mayweather. Where's my money, bitch? Flood never paid me for our fight. Who am I, the IRS? Nope, but you might be the cryptozoo dev team. Now, in all seriousness, I do want to acknowledge something which actually kind of looks bad a bit on the developers because it turns out very few written contracts were actually done. So much of this were verbal deals like, oh, we'll take care of you. We'll give you 350K. We'll give you a million. We'll give you whatever. But then when it was time to actually sign the deals, there's just always delays. What kind of promises were made to you? Verbal promises basically. So verbal promises and then we follow up with like a physical paper agreement. But that's when communication broke down. This is where I think the dev guys screwed up and led to this whole situation of like, okay, we're just going to take the code private until you pay us for our work. And to be clear, I'm not justifying not paying someone for what they did. I'm just playing Devils advocate and saying, this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail and writing. And I think it's just a good general lesson. But if you're thinking that that's the million dollar mystery solved, well, no. Because this still doesn't make sense. Why not just pay the dev team? What you publicly said, you kind of already paid them. Why not pay for a game that now isn't launched and now investors are so angry about? Why not pay when you already made millions from minting the eggs on this game? Well, this is where things get even stranger because right when I was ready to pin everything on Logan and believe me, he is at fault. I was speaking to the Z developer and I heard a name that I hadn't heard before. I basically came in with an addy and had he promised me, you know, five percent tokens and a billion dollars. You never really never gave me. Wait a second. Who's Eddie? I thought that all of this was Logan Paul. I only put it together when the blockchain center guys also said a similar thing about their deal. They said they were promised 350K and it was Ibanez. They say they had no communications with Logan. But we know they weren't talking about different people. They both dealt with the same guy. So the guy's name I put it together must be Eddie Ibanez turns out he was managing the developers. What's this random guy doing in Logan Paul's project and who is Eddie Ibanez? Yes, hi, my name is Eddie Ibanez. If you leave the developer here, it's crypto zoo. This reporter says Eddie's entire story is fake. Wait, what? You continuously lie, laid people on, hyped people up, put more money in, all the while in the background. Things are going down, things are hitting the fan and you left us holding the bag. Logan, you stole 40 million in tokens from me. You are a scam artist. You are a liar and you betrayed your own community. You aren't that guy. Logan replies, oh trust me bro, I am that guy. For the last six months, I've been working on my own NFT project. CryptoZoo.co. It's a really fun game that makes you money. I lost around $50,000 in cryptos. I lost $40,000. $500,000 Australian. It's the... I'm telling you, it's just a picture. There's nothing I could do with it. Wait, you can't even hatch? No. We had a f***ing issue with CryptoZoo where our lead developer took the code. He took the code that he made, Fledt Switzerland, and actually Fledt Switzerland. And like held it hostage for a million dollars. He never, really never paid me. Anything, I'll never ever... Eddie promised me, you know, five suit tokens. And a million dollars, never, really never paid me. Wait a second. Who is Eddie? I thought that all of this was Logan Paul. What's this random guy doing in Logan Paul's project? And who is Eddie Ivanoff? To begin answering the question of who Eddie is, I decided to take a deep dive. I started by looking through all the news articles I could on Eddie, where I found out he graduated from MIT, and from there became a data scientist and cyber security expert, and used that technical background to win a Super Bowl for the Eagles. And there were videos on him too, which all painted him as brilliant and extremely accomplished. Yes, hi, my name's Eddie Ivanoff. I'm a father and a three. I lead the developer here at Crypto Zoo. As a teenager, he successfully hacked AOL from his bedroom. He continued to pursue computer science until attending MIT. He was then recruited out to work for a government agency in cyber security, developing software that reverse engineers' location of known government and terrorist threats. You started with the federal government and you started off really tracking criminals with burn-of-phones and all that. Honestly, after this whole search, I felt more confused than ever. If Eddie's such an amazing guy, why didn't he pay developers? And is he really the puppet master behind Crypto Zoo? Or is it someone else? Honestly, I felt like at this point I needed a drink, and I needed to ask for help. Coffee, how's it going? Not good. Oh, what happened? Well, I'm confused about this Eddie Ibanez guy. He comes out of nowhere with his Crypto Zoo story and everything about him I find seems great. So, what's the problem? Well, everything's not great. Everything about this guy just seems too perfect. He's an MIT grad, he works for the military. He even claims he won a Super Bowl. Why would that guy work for Logan Paul? I don't know, but I can find out. He said his name is Eddie Ibanez. I think he goes by Eduardo technically, but wait, what are you doing? I'm just looking around and done. Well, what'd you find? Ferex flags, a couple of misdemeanors. Ooh, a few court cases, I'll send him over. He got sued by his landlord for not paying rent, sued by his credit card company for not paying his bill. You can skip that stuff. I just need whatever's relevant to Crypto Zoo. Well, that's basically it, other than, hold on. No wait, I did find something. Look, look at this. What's this? It's from a paper and filly. I barely picked it up. This reporter says Eddie's entire story is fake. Wait, what? Yeah, the whole Eddie Ibanez character. This guy Adam Rob investigated it. He says it's a lie. I gotta find this guy. He sent me his info. I got some calls to make. A coffee. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. We met up with Adam Rob, the reporter who's been investigating Eddie Ibanez for a while now. And I wanted to know, what did Adam think of it when they first met? I wasn't quite sure what to make of them. They said what I knew about him. He was a MIT grad who went on to work for the CIA and defense department. And I didn't want to waste his time. And it wasn't long after I sat down that I realized he was wasting my time. Can you tell me about some of the lies Eddie told you? Eddie has told me so many lies over the course of my two interviews with him. And the first lie he told me is probably the oldest lie that he's told so many people, which is that he's an orphan. I first realized Eddie might be lying to me when I went home the next day and Googled Eddie Ibanez's family. I found a video of Eddie and his wife making a rice pudding on Fox and Friends segment on Fox News. And Eddie's wife Jackie explains that she learned the recipe from Eddie's mother. So in the picture you've got to Jackie Ibanez, you know her along with her husband Eddie and her two little girls. You know, off rice pudding. Why is this a family recipe? Okay, so Eddie's mom made this rice pudding once. Wait, Eddie's mom. I thought Eddie was an orphan. Hold, it turns out the only problem with that is that not only does his mom exist, she's alive and in his life. And it turns out it wasn't just Adam that heard this story either. He told it a lot. Did you ever meet his mother or his parents? I did meet his mother. Did he ever tell you who was an orphan? Yes. How did he swear that with you? So that's why I said he's told me who's orphan and all this stuff that I meet his mom. He told me he was an orphan and then I met his mother. Is quite the string of words. But as insane as these lies are, let's be real. It doesn't explain why cryptos who failed. But the next lies kind of do because part of Eddie's story is also that he went to MIT where he was recruited to the CIA. And it's part of why he was so attractive as a lead developer, although wild experiences that he had had. But it's just not true. I emailed the MIT RedStore's office and I asked if Eddie Ibanez attended the school and they confirmed in absolute terms that he never attended MIT. That's right, the whole orphan to MIT origin story, it wasn't true. And Eddie's whole backstory from here kind of falls apart as well. How could he have been recruited to a government agency out of MIT if he never went to MIT? If this is all seeming crazy to you, you might ask yourself who would believe all this? And this is where Eddie shines. He kind of had a gift for getting people to believe in the lies he told. Especially super rich and powerful people for some reason. And to take for instance this story, him winning the Super Bowl for the Philadelphia Eagles. He managed to convince the owner of the New York Yankees that it was true, Barry Carberg, who completely bought into it without question and told the same story later in a college seminar. I was from our right hand to the right. He did for the Philadelphia Eagles, which led to a Super Bowl championship, led to you getting a Super Bowl ring. Tell us exactly what your job was to do for them and how we worked out. I was sure things. So the first off they said, we don't know where to put you. And then the sports side, the guy, he's like, hey, I got some data. I'm interested. So we took in his data. And we found out that these players, what happens is it's like a player as they run around. They get at certain fatigue levels. So if you think if you ever played Street Fighter, the video game, there's like a red bar at the top. And every time you get hit, that red bar goes down until you die. So then we're trying to figure out kind of what it that is for a player. And on an injury level, right, there's injury part of it. It's back down and that gets chaos. This is insane. He convinced an owner of the Yankees that he won a Super Bowl by turning sports athletes into Street Fighter characters. And of course, none of it's true. The Philadelphia Eagles responded to a fact check saying he never worked for their player analysis team. Not only that, the Eagles also said that Eddie did try to do an in-person presentation in March of 2018, but that was already a month after the Eagles had already won the Super Bowl. And also they didn't hire him because of course not. Meaning there's no way this story is true. And yet he's convinced people at the highest levels of sports that it is. And this is where we get back to Crypto Zoo, of course, because it's how he got involved with that project. Remember Jeff Levin, Logan's manager who we spoke to last time? Well, he also spoke to Adam Robb. And when he told him the reasons he liked Eddie, they sounded very familiar. And did he tell you I guess kind of like about working at the NFL and that kind of stuff in the whole? Yeah, like it's time to CIA and all that. He did. And it was interesting. It was like, this is wild. You know, like, that's pretty cool. But he's once again, he's hugged the release. He's not like ever grabbed you or anything like that. Wait, wait, but he is bragging. He literally made it all up. The CIA, NFL stories, or true. How could that not be bragging? But that's the impression Eddie gave off. But that's not all because Eddie didn't just use made up stories to get in with the Crypto Zoo team. He also used his other connections, his real millionaire and billionaire friends that he's managed to gain with all these fake stories. And some of them vouched for him. People like Chris Birch and Todd Morley. And what was the thing that kind of like solute Eddie? Was it the fact that like Chris and Todd and people like that kind of like have backed him in the past? And like, I just think he's a down to earth cool, humble guy who's been who's been super successful. They're trying to do an agenda and he's just kind of like, hey, look, super smart. What I know and I have amazing relationships through business that I've done. It's incredible. I mean, how does this guy keep getting away with it? Honestly, it's baffling. But I've got to say, up till now, everyone's been full sort of fair and square on the same grounds. I found out crypto zoo did have an advantage that could have saved them all this trouble the whole time. So a month before the launch of crypto zoo, I got in the phone with Jeff Levin, Logan Paul's manager. And after he spoke fondly of Eddie and his work, I confronted him about some of Eddie's lies, including how he didn't work for the NFL. Jeff told me he doesn't know much about the NFL, but he knows about the business world. And Chris Birch and Todd Morley vouched for Eddie. And so Jeff and Logan were going to continue working with him. Have you ever verified that anything Eddie said about himself is true? We verified them too. Yeah, we definitely talked to people. And his friends and people that he said he has relationships with, which we've confirmed up to your show. Okay, because I had trouble with some of that, like, with the NFL, like saying that, like, no, we've never worked with him. And that kind of thing. But you've had... The NFL, the NFL saying that. Yeah. Like who the NFL? The comsteens for the Eagles and the dolphins. And then the people specifically, he named the he said he worked with. I don't know necessarily the football stuff. Okay. I don't have relationships with the football world. Sure. But the business world, you know, we've definitely talked to multiple people. Like Todd and Chris and they back to him. Correct. Wait a second. This means at minimum, Jeff knew about Eddie's background beforehand or part of it and still decided to go with him. This is just unbelievable, willful stupidity. And since Jeff is Logan's manager, I assume him and the team should have known about this as well. But still, they went forward with it even though they knew this stuff before launch. Now, I started to reach out for comments about this because obviously this is a huge deal. But when I did, I got a call from somebody new. Someone with a different perspective that I hadn't heard from before. Jake, the cryptok. He's been involved with some of Logan's projects in the past, like Pokemon, for example. He was called the Collectibles Guru a few years ago. Nowadays, he goes by cryptok and he's an advisor for the crypto zoo project. So let's add him to the conspiracy board. But the question is, what did he have to say? I took a call with him and he mostly wanted to talk off the record. But when I pressed him, he was willing to at least put one thing on the record for me. Right. One more thing about Eddie before we get off of him. We actually have got... I see this reason it felt in my opinion. Okay. Because I don't want it to ever be thought that Logan's the reason it felt. He's not. Logan wasn't smart enough for what he tried to build. And then when it was built and was failing, didn't have the ability to correct it. And to save face and reputation, it was more convenient to pull out than to be associated with the failing project that the dev rock. So I could put that one sentence on the record. Well, that is certainly emphatic. CryptoKing says it's all Eddie's fault. And this is a nice neat theory for us. You know, Eddie ruined everything because yeah, Eddie is a liar. So it does seem to explain how these developers got screwed. But this theory doesn't fit all the facts because Eddie was kicked off the team months ago. And still, the game is not working. Despite Logan claiming they were going to go back and fix all the problems. Again, retroactively working to make these projects right. And this just takes time, bro. It just takes time. Development takes time. Working backwards to fix things, which isn't ideal. But also this project will speak for itself. And now, you know, we're working backwards to try to fix it. This just hasn't happened. Even a year from launch, the game just doesn't exist. What's worse, is the newest dev team who came on after Eddie just quit. And one of the reasons was they hadn't been paid for over a month. I know this because Logan's team is leakier than the Titanic and someone told me that. But we also have blockchain evidence. This is Jeff. Paying block ops, the company they hired out on July 19th. They were supposed to redo all this work. It's confirmed by their leader, Skip, talking about a first monthly payment on that day. But after that, there's nothing until they quit on September 26th in a post called our departure from cryptozoo. Now, I do have to say it does look like they were eventually paid, but only a day after they quit. And this is just the same problem as before, slightly different. Nobody can pay these devs on time and investors end up getting nothing. And so I can't buy into the idea that Eddie's at fault for everything. Because when Eddie was gone, they had a lot of the same problems. Now, it was only at the point that this dev team quit block ops that things really took a turn. Because if the Titanic was leaking before, now it was sinking. And everyone basically gave up hope. You know, from every direction, I started getting messages from all the investors who felt betrayed, who up to this point were holding on to hope. Now they felt defeated. They felt tricked by the cryptozoo team who had fed them promise after promise. And they were sick of it. He was never in each other, and he didn't ever apologize to her or just anything. Things didn't work out. Things didn't work out. We'll get that. But to continuously lie, lead people on, hype people up, to put more money in, all the while in the background. Things are going down, things are hitting the fan. And you left us holding the bag. I know it was my decision. And I did my research. But I believe nobody has to lose money in this way. And that's when a whistleblower stepped forward and decided enough was enough. They decided to leak me messages, team messages from the cryptozoo team from all the way back in the beginning when they thought of this idea all the way up to launch. And seeing that, it changed everything. Because all of a sudden, I got a lot of new information. Remember how Jake, the crypto king, said Eddie was the only problem? Well, a year ago, he was saying something very different. On the day of launch, he said this to the group, Logan, you stole 40 million in tokens from me. You are a scam artist. You are a liar, and you betrayed your own community. You aren't that guy. Logan replies, oh Jake, trust me bro. I am that guy. You're going to take full fucking story. Yeah, I'll go on the record for you. And yes, I'm going to show you the text message that said we can sell at these ascending market cats. And it's not like I was trying to applaud the project. It's like I put 250,000 dollars into a project. So six months of time. And the founder never did anything to say he was going to do. And then hired a bunch of devs that didn't do what they were going to do. And every time I gave advice, the advice was I was going to fucking fuck. So there's not anything illegal about that. Antiquely, argument. The rest that Logan did to me was Antiquely, gone and illegal. For the last six months, I've been working on my own NFT project. We've put hundreds of thousands of dollars in it, personally, the whole team, a million plus. We had a **** issue with Crypto Zoo where our lead developer took the code that he made, fled Switzerland, actually fled Switzerland and held it hostage for a million dollars. You never really never gave me anything I will ever ever promise me, you know, buy a pursuit of it and a million dollars. You never really never gave me. This reporter says Eddie's entire story is fake. Liam. Got you, this reason it fell in my opinion. Doug, I'm not the **** bad guy here. Yeah. There's some actual **** out there. Yeah. And it's on me. Like, I'm here to build. Welcome to part three. So far, we've discovered fake orphans, millions of dollars stolen and a cast of sleazy characters, but now it's time to put it all together. What is the truth? And who's to blame? We're going to start by going through leaked text messages of the Crypto Zoo team to understand all of their motivation. Then we'll go to blockchain, evidence and show who sold what. And finally, we'll confront some of the people responsible. But before we can do any of that, we have to start in March of 2021. Six months before the token even launched, our four suspects, Logan, Crypto King, Eddie and Jeff are in a group chat discussing Crypto Zoo, which starts as a copy of something else. Quote, I like imitating Crypto Kiddies. Jake, the Crypto King says, Logan replies, I agree. And initially, it wasn't called Crypto Zoo at all. It was called Crypto Pets. And they were going to sell a pet's token. And pretty early on it became clear, this was all about money. How they were going to sell this thing to investors. In fact, Crypto King said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars and only six months, saying the range is insane. 20 to 210 million dollars. It's beautiful wherever we land. Eddie jumped in at this point and talked about how he could sell the project as an investment to a friend Matt Higgins, saying, quote, he has to spend that $350 million somewhere. Why not us? And Logan says, I love that idea. Crypto King, I'm in. And of course you have Jeff saying, let's go. So you can see right there, they wanted to sell this game before it didn't even launch. Now later, Eddie amends the list of investors and says, quote, investors will be Gary Vee, Todd Morley, James Altature, Ryan Kavanaugh, and others confirmed on my end. Supposedly, they had a hundred million dollars of investment interest. Now, I actually went to some of these investors and asked if this was true. And the one person who responded denied it, Ryan Kavanaugh. Quote, nope, not even a little bit. So this looks like it could be yet another lie from Eddie Ibanez. But either way, it looks like there was more issues than just finding investors because the team wanted to pre-sell tokens. And not everyone was sure it would be legal. Jake the crypto king mentions that quote, if we have a pre-sell, it opens us up to SEC issues. And Jeff agrees and says, don't want to do anything that brings the SEC eyeballs. Now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though. Logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins. Eddie agrees, he says, you absolutely can do it. I have the SEC down, private and pre-sell. And honestly, it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money. You know, do a pre-sale, make millions, but you know, you have these potential legal issues. Don't do it, you make less money. So crypto king comes up with a middle solution. He says, if we can't sell, no pre-sale. We can still trade them in the liquidity pool. And this is the start of a new disaster, which takes a bit of explaining. Now just to work clear, a pre-sale is where you sell investors coins, usually at a discount before you've launched. And then when you launch, you give them those coins. Now like I said, the team didn't want to do that. So what they did instead was they bought the tokens on the open market right after launch. But they tried to get clever with it because they didn't actually announce that they were launching this coin at all. They still launched it on June 11th and didn't announce this token through Logan until August 18th. Meaning they had all that time to silently buy up as much of the supply at a steep discount as they wanted. And the idea here was that doing this, the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply, which is kind of like a pre-sale, but you know, without all the SEC troubles. And crypto king makes this clear on June 7th when he says, quote, launch of the liquidity pool is where huge money will be made because you get in cheaper. And then says, we, the team, begin buying out the liquidity pool. Once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying, we send the contract address to friends, family, investors, who want to be able to get in. So obviously the plan is we buy first, then we give it to our close friends and family, and then maybe the public eventually, right? And even the day before, crypto king reminds everyone, quote, Zude is tomorrow. I highly recommend everyone get a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in zoom when it goes live. It will likely tend to a thousand X. So that was their plan. Rather than doing a pre-sale, they're going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way, but without all the legal troubles. Or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day, this is where things first started to go wrong for the team. At first, everything seemed to go normal. The team sat in a circle and literally bought it out as planned. But the next day, crypto king says something odd. Quote, a bot is playing with our token, kind of cool to watch them work, but he doesn't mention who this bot is. And he also says the a**hole finished selling, but doesn't mention who that is. Now Jeff Logan's manager replies upset. He says, how do we prevent someone doing what they just did again? We went from on 130 million to 26 million dollar mark cap in two hours. It's not cool to watch. Logan jumps in. Yeah, wait, how did that happen? And he also says what a**hole? How did anyone get this token except for us and none of us sold? And I think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what Logan's saying is, hey, we tried to scheme this really well. We tried to all buy this without letting anyone know. How did this, how did anyone else figure out we were buying it? Right? And this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting. Crypto king deflects the question by saying, my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and Logan says, no bro, F your buyer. Explain to me what just happened and how there were 30 token holders. And Jake tries to explain that this was just traders and bots happening to find the token. But Logan says only five of us knew about it. Jake says, well, many people chased volume and knew tokens. And in some extent he's kind of right. But Logan replies, cap, he doesn't believe him. Quote, I can't be the only one who thinks that's too incredibly convenient. Like someone was tipped off. And look, no one's more critical of Logan than me. But as I'm reading these texts, I was kind of like agreeing. Like, yeah, it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot. You know what I mean? Because Crypto king was acting very strange. He says, we created 40 million dollars out of thin air. This is a success. Logan replies, this nonchalant worries me. F 40 million, it was at 120 million. Which again, it's all about the money with these guys. But truth be told, I did agree that Crypto king's attitude seems strange in these texts. I mean, he's not wrong that bots are a thing. Traders are a thing. But it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it. So naturally, I looked into it. And what I found surprised me, because there were bots. But there's also unusual human activity during this time. So I tracked the five biggest buyers of the zoo coin. And lo and behold, this is what I found. Logan was one of the biggest buyers, which is what you'd expect. But he wasn't the biggest. In fact, two of the biggest wallets seem to be associated with Crypto king himself. And here's where I pause. I said, wait a second. Why did this guy buy more zoo tokens than Logan when this is mostly Logan's project? I thought Crypto king was a small part of this team. And so, to get more info on this, I actually got access to an internal meeting note from the day of June 11, which they called Zoo Day. And in it, we find actually some interesting information. We see that five founders bought in. They apparently were, quote, trading in circles until each person maxed out. But on the list of buyers and how much they spend are only four people. When we know five people bought, we have Danny, Logan's assistant for 20K, Logan Paul for 100K, Jeff at 100K, and Eddie at 100K, but Crypto king is nowhere to be found. And yet, on the blockchain, I have him putting in $200,000 worth. And this number, by the way, seemingly is confirmed in a conversation I had with Crypto king, where he said, my 200K investment. And the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch. Because Crypto king had a relatively small role in this whole project. He was the advisor, but it wasn't that big of a deal. Like you can see from the internal meeting notes. They have a breakdown of who's getting what in terms of founder tokens. And like Logan Paul's getting 51% and he's getting 30%, Jeff's getting 10%. Jake's only getting 5% of tokens. But he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens, which makes no sense. And it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like, oh, don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch. Maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token. Maybe he was buying it to sell later. Now of course, that's speculation. So that's why I confronted Crypto king on all of this. But before we get to that call, let's address the elephant in the room. Logan didn't accuse Crypto king of being a scam. It was the other way around. Crypto king told Logan Paul he was a scammer. And the question is why? Well, to answer that, we have to go from June, the stealth launch date, to September 1st, the official launch date of Crypto Zoo. September 1st, Crypto Zoo dot co. Now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think, well, they already have a token, right? But the first thing they did was actually create a new zoo token with a different code, but the same name. And they actually air dropped all the holders of the first zoo token with an identical amount of those coins on the second zoo token. So you might be wondering why did they do that? Well, maybe it's to change the smart contract, but maybe it's because of what they did do. They blacklisted some of the holders. In other words, they didn't air drop to everyone, including Jake the Crypto king. They excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins. Jake texted the group about this the next day, saying, quote, the zoo team made a major error this weekend. They chose not to communicate, meant a new token, and air drop it to whatever wallets they determined fit. This decision came from Eddie and Logan, and I had no partner. 11,250 wallets before the air drop under 11,000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets. Now who those wallets are, I have no idea. But he continues quote, as a founder, like Logan, Jeff, Eddie and Danny, I had purchased a large quantity of tokens. Five plus of my wallets had been blacklisted from the original team's boss. I don't know why he had five wall, five plus wallets there, but okay, okay. He says 80 plus billion zoo tokens were confiscated from me to date without any communication. So wow, that's why Crypto king accused Logan of stealing from him or scamming. It's because he was frozen out of a lot of his wallets. Then we get to the text, you guys all know, he says Logan, you stole $40 million, you're a scammer, you're a con artist, all that stuff. You betrayed your community. The reality is you aren't that guy. And Logan responds, oh, Jake, trust me, bro, I am that guy. Queue in the arms of an angel. And look, I mean, what do we make of this? Well, I don't know, I can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like Logan stabbed him in the back. But it sounds like Crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place, right? Because it does appear like he bought tokens that maybe everyone didn't know about. So I'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation. And by the way, this whole thing was structured so misleadingly from the beginning. I have to talk to you a bit about it because you might think that these tokens were the only tokens they had. But it's not even true. In the distribution section of zoos white paper, they say there's two trillion tokens. And a quarter of that are allocated to development, marketing, and founders. Those aren't even the tokens we're talking about right now. Because they claim that those tokens were locked up for six months. And then afterwards, 10% was unlocked every month. And if that's true, there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted, right? Why would you blacklist something that would be locked up? And the answer is because, well, the founders had more than one set of tokens. Not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold, these stealth launch tokens were different from that. It's like a whole different thing. And the tokens that they bought, that all of these guys bought, they could sell it basically any time because they weren't locked up, which is a massive problem. And this fact was explicitly laid out in their meeting notes with only one rule. They say, quote, no selling until $200 million market cap. And don't impact the market more than 3%, and not impact the market more than 10% in a day. And by the way, this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market. They literally have an insider rules for how to sell. But we're going to not even, we're going to look past that, right? Because these rules eventually kind of changed. A text from Logan's manager, Jeff Levin, came to the group chat, Zoo Founders, saying, guys, new and absolute rules. No one is to sell or transfer any zoo. Logan's going to make the call when we can make moves. Logan replies, your tokens do not leave your wallet. This is a game. Now, that all sounds well and good. Don't sell your tokens. Don't sell your tokens. But the reality was, I mean, they're just kind of trusting each other. Because these tokens that they're talking about, they're unlocked. They're not locked up. And they could sell it at any time. And I guess the question on my mind is, is that why Crypto King's tokens were blacklisted? Because they thought he would sell? Or maybe it's just the fact they found out he bought, and they didn't know about all those tokens. It's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence. And this is where we're going to jump into the blockchain. Now, I've tracked the wallets of the entire team, and identified the largest seller of Zoo in the team. And it wasn't Jeff. It wasn't Danny. It wasn't even Logan. It was Crypto King. Crypto King sold by my calculations millions of dollars. And I know what you're thinking. How's that possible, right? I thought his tokens were blacklisted the day of the official launch. How could he sell that much? Well, the answer is that not all of his tokens were blacklisted. He had even more tokens behind the scenes. And what's worse, the Crypto's new team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens, which I guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing, because he then turned around and sold those tokens, right? And from my blockchain analysis across his blacklisted tokens he got back, and the tokens that he had scrolled away the whole time, he ended up making $6 million. He did this by sending out tokens from these larger wallets to dozens of smaller wallets, selling it, and then sending the money to Final Cash Out wallets. So I used those final wallets to calculate the amount he made. Now, I know, look, it's a lot to accuse someone of selling $6 million in a project that doesn't even work to giant scam. So I wanted to give him a chance to defend himself. So I got him a call with Crypto King. And here's what he said when I finally revealed that I knew he had sold. It's going to take so long to be story. Yeah, I'll go on the record for you. And yes, I'm going to show you the cash message that said we can sell at these ascending market caps. I'm just 100% it sounds like your biggest issue with me is that I sold. And if that's your biggest issue with me, that's the truth. Wow, that is a big admission. Selling tokens for a project that you're an advisor on when the project has never been delivered. Although Crypto King insists that it wasn't $6 million and he wasn't trying to rug a project. In fact, you know, really he might be the one who got screwed over on all of this. I did sell I didn't sell $6 million worth. That's going to be other wallets, but that's probably not going to be me being proven. Except for them saying can you send B&B to all these different wallets for me, which then I'll be able to show you that I was giving me the whole thing. I'll also be able to show you that I was a 5% holder of these tokens that I was promised to be given over the three month period. Just never give it. I can also show you that I was frozen out. I was never given the 15 billion tokens back that I paid for in cash. I'll show you all of those things on the record. And then you can also say that I did sell, which is also true. As long as it's a company with people as they founders that was supposed to be in 5% of the project and was never given the token or paid or for almost a year on the project. As long as that goes in with it, then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like I was trying to rug a project. It's like I put $250,000 into a project plus six months of time. And the founder never did anything that he said he was going to do and then hired a bunch of devs that went into what they were going to do. And every time I gave advice, the advice was I was supposed to pop off. So it can be that story or it can be he sold all this amount and he got in or well, yeah, that's like 1% of it. Incredible. He sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too. Which just has to win the gold medal for me for mental gymnastics because I mean, he literally had put $200,000 into this and he says he made millions of dollars. Even if you take him at his word that he didn't make the full 6 million, he admits to me later that it might be a pretty close guess. He tells me via text quote, I don't care if you tell people I sold a few million and leave it at that. Well, okay, $6 million, a few million dollars, it's millions of dollars, right? Millions of dollars when you only put in $200,000 into a project that's never been delivered, doesn't work, scam people out of their money. How is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong? Well, in his view, what he did was not wrong. It might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal. And what Logan did, well, that was illegal. You can say the timing was bad and it was inappropriate to sell. But the reality is I've bought tokens open market and sold them open market. So there's nothing illegal about that. Ascically, archival, the rest that Logan did to me was ascically teed from and illegal. Now, what do I think of all this finger pointing? Well, I think it's pretty wild to try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions. I just do. Now at the same time, I want to be fair to CryptoKin. He's not the only one who sold here. But I also have to say not everyone from the founders did sell. For example, Jeff Logan's manager to my knowledge never sold. Neither did Logan Paul, which was a huge surprise. All their walls that I tracked, you know, held onto their tokens, which is good. And to their credit for a game that doesn't work. But you know who did sell? Eddie Ibanez. The guy who didn't pay the initial devs, the supposed MIT orphan? Yeah, from what I could see, his initial wall had got a ton of zoo, sent it to a bunch of smaller wallets, and then sold off. Kind of like CryptoKin. And for my calculations, he made about $1.7 million. Now, I have to tell you that like Jake, I tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself. But he never replied to my emails or my phone calls. And we're just going to have to leave it there. But we're not done with the money just yet. Because we still need to talk about the eggs. Remember we talked about how they profited from ZooCoin, but they also made millions from eggs. According to their own internal meeting notes, they plan to make about $3 million, selling these eggs for.1 a piece. And that's not far from what I calculated they actually did make, which was about $2.5 million. In the meeting notes, they say they're going to clear expenses and then do payouts. But payout who? They don't say. And these expenses are referencing an earlier note suggesting Eddie and Logan had both spent $300,000 each, which I'll say is not $1 million. But okay, we'll give it to him, right? So they got paid back, there's $600,000, but where does the rest of the money go? Well, on the Ethereum side, there's one payout for $364,000 to one wallet. And another million dollars to another. They both are Coinbase addresses, so we don't know who exactly that is. Clearly, someone on the team made a lot of money from these NFT egg sales that do not work. And on the Binance smart chain side where they also made money selling eggs, the zoo that was spent was supposed to be set aside for 50% to be burned, which they did. But the other 50% was supposed to be allocated for wildlife charities and crypto zoo development. Now, neither seems to have happened because all the money is in a wallet that the team still controls, so they're open questions about, you know, where that money is going to go. And where the Ethereum money went? Did it go to Jake? Did it go to Logan? Did it go to Jeff? Did it go to Eddie? We don't know. But what I know for sure is that no one was innocent, although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about. Because, of course, not everyone did sell. You could look at that as the most important thing. Logan Paul didn't sell. Jeff, Logan's manager didn't sell. But does that make them innocent? Well, I don't think so, because they never built a game they promised people. Logan Paul specifically got millions of dollars spent on this game on the promise of the technology that he never built, that his team never built. And he never addressed the failure, except to blame his developers who weren't paid. And you could say he promised to work backwards to fix it, but then never did. But at the same time, it's clearly not just Logan's fault either, because there are major team issues, right? You've got Eddie selling millions of dollars of zoo, and then allegedly not paying developers. You've got Jeff, who was warned about Eddie, who kept him on the team anyways. And then after they fired Eddie, seems to also have failed to pay developers on time. And then you've got crypto king himself, who sold the most. But claims he was the guy who was scammed, which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. It's just like a vinger's assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto game. And so unsurprisingly, it turns out a lot of these guys backstabbed each other. And so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult, because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame. Because if you focus on any one person, you kind of miss why this project failed. Crypto Zoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low. Crypto Zoo failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised. Really, the number one problem, even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens, was that they never paid the developers on time, as boring as that is. And as a result, the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars, which is a problem, but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning, which was not a crypto project, but something different. I'm excited to watch my game. You keep using it again. You keep using a word there. Game. You're not using like a project. It's a game. It's a game. It's a really fun game that makes you money. That's it. That to me is the biggest scam in all of this. Yes, it's a huge problem. People stole millions of dollars, but it's a symptom of the larger issue, which is people didn't actually care about the game or whatever you want to call it. They just cared about the money. And this is ultimately what happens when you have an influencer, larping as a businessman. It's what happens when you have a liar, larping as a developer, and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru, larping as a crypto king. You end up with a mess, and in my personal opinion, a fraud as well. And now that this thing blew up in their faces, these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than SBF dodges calls with me. Because I have reached out to everyone involved. I've tried to get all of their statements on things. So far, no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all. They're all hiding. Pretending these victims don't even exist. But they do exist. And throughout my investigations, they've been the heartbeat of this whole thing. So I decided to close this investigations in a bit of a unique way. Rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think, I want to give them the last word. Everyone's to blame. Logan, in the sense of his name is called management, his head project. He still made these promises to people. I think everyone it is to blame, including Logan Paul, of course, because he was the one in charge of this. And he was responsible for all of this mess. Everybody has a big part and a massive, massive cross-to-bear. Each one of them scanned the project in their own way, and then off. The sun suddenly went. It was his job to check the team to make sure that everyone is working together to make sure that he is giving the funds of the people that put it into his project under his name to people that he actually trust. So in my opinion, if the team failed to perform, that's Logan Paul to blame. The communities destroyed. People is angry. They just want their money back. They just want their normal life back. Reimbursed, reimbursed those loyal fans that they have, or had to rebuild the project, actually deliver on the project for those who are so holding their eggs like I am. For those holding the zoo coins, so maybe they could just deliver what they promised, and that would give some redemption to this piascal. He's not said a word. That's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money. It's not coming out and just being a man about it. At least we deserve to know what was happening behind the scenes while we were waiting for almost a year and a half. The fact that we're hearing this information not from an involved but from pretty much a investigator, it really says a lot. What did this last mean to me? It meant a lot, not just personally because I lost quite a lot of money in my kid and also my wife were invested. It was like telling a kid that Santa doesn't exist or something like that because she really believed in all that game. She really believed in Logan Paul. Kids look up to that kind of people. So it was some kind of broken dream. My mother had got a mum, my mum was invested. My sister was also invested. So I mean my daughter even had a couple of the eggs and animals which the lost for them hurts the most because obviously she's not nice to see. To somebody to win, somebody has to lose. That's a gamble you take whether you get into crypto or not. I got in knowing that I could lose. Which is fine. That's on me. But I thought if I lost something it would be because I sold it the wrong time. Or the game didn't earn as much as I thought it would and therefore my fingers were earn as valuable. But I never, you never go into it thinking it's not something that they're going to just sell out from underneath you because they could make so much more. If they actually delivered on what they said, even if they delivered on close to what they said. And that's the thing is you don't think they're going to rugby because there was so much money in a game wallet. Ultimately at the end the way I see it is it was fraud. Love and could have could have put out the red flags. All people would stop investing more into it because people were invested. People were still investing to this project and to the very last minute where the ship was still just sinking down the ocean and people were still putting their cash into it. If I was on a cold, Logan Paul, I would ask him where did his redemption art go. I think he was on such a good streak going about his YouTube career and boxing as well. And it's sad to see that because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his youths. What would I say to Logan Paul and his team if I pulled? Well actually I cool because I have an NFT from other projects that gives me the right to see Logan Paul to meet and greet with him. And I will actually use that right to tell him this story again. Show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family, my whole family and my kids are affected with this situation. Because I think that's what he would think. You would think that Logan would have told his fellow followers, his loyal fans, that hey guys back off, red flag, things are turbulence in the water. No, not a single word, nothing. What sort of... I think that is inhumane the way that that side of us has been marketed. Knowing what's happened since, knowing that all of the people that were there from the beginning, like all of the guys that I'd speak to on a daily basis that we've all just got nothing now. Ideally I just want to say I'll see you in court.\""

want to follow up on that.', 'i have no comment for it.', \"okay, you're are you guys denying it?\", \"are you saying it's not true?\", 'no comment.', \"i don't think that the information is true.\", \"okay, because they're saying a million dollars hasn't been paid in development for crypto zoo.\", 'i said publicly that it has been paid.', \"so i mean, it's pretty serious accusation.\", \"and obviously i don't want to just run a story.\", 'if you guys have a whole side story here, your job, your job as a, as someone that is reporting news is to actually verify correct news.', 'right.',

why i'm calling you.\", \"they've given me a lot of things.\", 'a lot of evidence.', 'okay.', 'well, okay.', \"you can you can have the evidence you want, but i'm just letting you know if you report anything on us.\", 'i appreciate your business.', 'i appreciate you as a person.', \"and i'm just telling you, you know, from legal standpoint.\", \"as we've been advised always is if anybody reports fake news.\", \"that's where we won't, you know, yeah, this call was a mess.\", \"jeff logan's manager seems to be implying that i'm not allowed to repeat allegations his own development team made.\",

that maybe we'll sue you if you tell this to anyone.\", \"which he then denies doing when i ask him if that's what he's doing.\", \"told you i'm no comment to it telling you once again from a legal standpoint, you have to report truth.\", \"if you do not verify truth, then you're just allegations.\", 'and those then will be handled the way that we want to handle.', \"wait, so you're saying you're saying you refuse to give me proof that the allegations aren't true.\", 'but if i report on the allegations, you guys might sue.', 'no, no, i did not say that.', 'i did not say that.', \"i'm just i'm trying to read between the lines.\", \"don't read between the lines.\", 'okay.', \"listen to the words that i'm saying.\", 'okay.', \"because i'm saying i'm listening.\", 'i have no comment

million.\", \"we'll give you whatever.\", \"but then when it was time to actually sign the deals, there's just always delays.\", 'what kind of promises were made to you?', 'verbal promises

just playing devils advocate and saying, this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail and writing.\", \"and i think it's just a good general lesson.\", \"but if you're thinking that

mit if he never went to mit?', 'if this is all seeming crazy to you, you might ask yourself who would believe all this?', 'and this is where eddie shines.', 'he kind of had a gift for getting people to believe in the lies he told.', 'especially super rich and powerful people for some reason.', 'and to take for instance this story, him winning the super bowl for the philadelphia eagles.', 'he managed to convince the owner of the new york yankees that it was true, barry carberg, who completely bought into it without question and told the same story later in a college seminar.', 'i was from our right hand to the right.', 'he did for the philadelphia eagles, which led to a super bowl championship, led to you getting a super bowl ring.', 'tell us exactly what your job was to do for them

interested.\", 'so we took in his data.', \"and we found out that these players, what happens is it's like a player as they run around.\", 'they get at certain fatigue levels.', \"so if you think if you ever played street fighter, the video game, there's like a red bar at the top.\", 'and every time you get hit, that red bar goes down until you die.', \"so then we're trying to figure out kind of what it that is for a player.\", \"and on an injury level, right, there's injury part of it.\", \"it's back down and that gets chaos.\", 'this is insane.', 'he convinced an owner of the yankees that he won a super bowl by turning sports athletes into street fighter characters.', \"and of course, none of it's true.\", 'the philadelphia eagles responded to a fact check saying he never worked for their player analysis team.', 'not only that, the eagles also said that eddie did try to do an in-person presentation in march of 2018, but that was already a month after the eagles had already won the super bowl.', \"and also they didn't hire him because of course not.\", \"meaning there's no way this story is true.\", \"and yet he's convinced people at the highest levels of sports that it is.\", \"and this is where we get back to crypto zoo, of course, because it's how he got involved with that project.\", \"remember jeff levin, logan's manager who we spoke to last time?\", 'well, he also spoke to adam robb.', 'and when he told him the reasons he liked eddie, they sounded very familiar.', 'and did he tell you i guess kind of like about working at the nfl and that kind of stuff in the whole?', \"yeah, like it's time to cia and all that.\", 'he did.', 'and it was interesting.', 'it was like, this is wild.', \"you know, like, that's pretty cool.\", \"but he's once again, he's hugged the release.\", \"he's not like ever grabbed you or anything like that.\", 'wait, wait, but he is bragging.', 'he literally made it all up.', 'the cia, nfl stories, or true.', 'how could that not be bragging?', \"but that's the impression eddie gave off.\", \"but that's not all because eddie didn't just use made up stories to get in with the crypto zoo team.\", \"he also used his other connections, his real millionaire and billionaire friends that he's managed to gain with all these fake stories.\", 'and some of them vouched for him.', 'people like chris birch and todd morley.',

down to earth cool, humble guy who's been who's been super successful.\", \"they're trying to do an agenda and he's just kind of like, hey, look, super smart.\", \"what i know and i have amazing relationships through business that i've done.\", \"it's incredible.\", 'i mean, how does this guy keep getting away with it?', \"honestly, it's baffling.\", \"but i've got to say, up till now, everyone's been full sort of fair and square on the same grounds.\", 'i found out crypto zoo did have an advantage that could have saved them all this trouble the whole time.', \"so a month before the launch of crypto zoo, i got in the phone with jeff levin, logan paul's manager.\", \"and after he spoke fondly of eddie and his work, i confronted him about some of eddie's lies, including how he didn't work for the nfl.\", \"jeff told me he doesn't know much about the nfl, but he knows about the business world.\", 'and chris birch and todd morley vouched for eddie.', 'and so jeff and logan were going to continue working with him.', 'have you ever verified that anything eddie said about himself is true?', 'we verified them too.', 'yeah, we definitely talked to people.', \"and his friends and people that he said he has relationships with, which we've confirmed up to your show.\", \"okay, because i had trouble with some of that, like, with the nfl, like saying that, like, no, we've never worked with him.\", 'and that kind of thing.', \"but you've had...\", 'the nfl, the nfl saying that.', 'yeah.', 'like who the nfl?', 'the comsteens for the eagles and the dolphins.', 'and then the people specifically, he named the he said he worked with.', \"i don't know necessarily the football stuff.\", 'okay.', \"i don't have relationships with the football world.\", 'sure.', \"but the business world, you know, we've definitely talked to multiple people.\", 'like todd and chris and they back to him.', 'correct.', 'wait a second.', \"this means at minimum, jeff knew about eddie's background beforehand or part of it and still decided to go with him.\", 'this is just unbelievable, willful stupidity.', \"and since jeff is logan's manager, i assume him and the team should have known about this as well.\", 'but still, they went forward with it even though they knew this stuff before launch.', 'now, i started to reach out for comments about this because obviously this is a huge deal.', 'but when i did, i got a call from somebody new.', \"someone with a different perspective that i hadn't heard from before.\", 'jake, the cryptok.', \"he's been involved with some of logan's projects in the past, like pokemon, for example.\", 'he was called the collectibles guru a few years ago.', \"nowadays, he goes by cryptok and he's an advisor for the crypto zoo project.\", \"so let's add him to the conspiracy board.\", 'but the question is, what did he have to say?', 'i took a call with him and he mostly wanted to talk off the record.', 'but when i pressed him, he was willing to at least put one thing on the record for me.', 'right.', 'one more thing about eddie before we get off of him.', 'we actually have got...', 'i see this reason it felt in my opinion.', 'okay.', \"because i don't want it to ever be thought that logan's the reason it felt.\", \"he's not.\", \"logan wasn't smart enough for what he tried to build.\", \"and then when it was built and was failing, didn't have the ability to correct it.\", 'and to save face and reputation, it was more convenient to pull out than to be associated with the failing project that the dev rock.', 'so i could put that one sentence on the record.', 'well, that is certainly emphatic.', \"cryptoking says it's all eddie's fault.\", 'and this is a nice neat theory for us.', 'you know, eddie ruined everything because yeah, eddie is a liar.', 'so it does seem to explain how these developers got screwed.', \"but this theory doesn't fit all the facts because eddie was kicked off the team months ago.\", 'and still, the game is not working.', 'despite logan claiming they were going to go back and fix all the problems.', 'again, retroactively working to make these projects right.', 'and this just takes time, bro.', 'it just takes time.', 'development takes time.', \"working backwards to fix things, which isn't ideal.\", 'but also this project will speak for itself.', \"and now, you know, we're working backwards to try to fix it.\", \"this just hasn't happened.\", \"even a year from launch, the game just doesn't exist.\", \"what's worse, is the newest dev team who came on after eddie just quit.\", \"and one of the reasons was they hadn't been paid for over a month.\", \"i know this because logan's team is leakier than the titanic and someone told me that.\", 'but we also have blockchain evidence.', 'this is jeff.', 'paying block ops, the company they hired out on july 19th.', 'they were supposed to redo all this work.', \"it's confirmed by their leader, skip, talking about a first monthly payment on that day.\", \"but after that, there's nothing until they quit on september 26th in a post called our departure from cryptozoo.\", 'now, i do have to say it does look like they were eventually paid, but only a day after they quit.', 'and this is just the same problem as before, slightly different.', 'nobody can pay these devs on time and investors end up getting nothing.', \"and so i can't buy into the idea that eddie's at fault for everything.\", 'because when eddie was gone, they had a lot of the same problems.', 'now, it was only at the point that this dev team quit block ops that things really took a turn.', 'because if the titanic was leaking before, now it was sinking.', 'and everyone basically gave up hope.', 'you know, from every direction, i started getting messages from all the investors who felt betrayed, who up to this point were holding on to hope.', 'now they felt defeated.', 'they felt tricked by the cryptozoo team who had fed them promise after promise.', 'and they were sick of it.', \"he was never in each other, and he didn't ever apologize to her or just anything.\", \"things didn't work out.\", \"things didn't work out.\", \"we'll get that.\", 'but to continuously lie, lead people on, hype people up, to put more money in, all the while in the background.', 'things are going down, things are hitting the fan.', 'and you left us holding the bag.', 'i know it was my decision.', 'and i did my research.', 'but i believe nobody has to lose money in this way.', \"and that's when a whistleblower stepped forward and decided enough was enough.\", 'they decided to leak me messages, team messages from the cryptozoo team from all the way back in the beginning when they thought of this idea all the way up to launch.', 'and seeing that, it changed everything.', 'because all of a sudden, i got a lot of new information.', 'remember how jake, the crypto king, said eddie was the only problem?', 'well, a year ago, he was saying something very different.', 'on the day of launch, he said this to the group, logan, you stole 40 million in tokens from me.', 'you are a scam artist.', 'you are a liar, and you betrayed your own community.', \"you aren't that guy.\", 'logan replies, oh jake, trust me bro.', 'i am that guy.', \"you're going to take full fucking story.\", \"yeah, i'll go on the record for you.\", \"and yes, i'm going to show you the text message that said we can sell at these ascending market cats.\", \"and it's not like i was trying to applaud the project.\", \"it's like i put 250,000 dollars into a project.\", 'so six months of time.', 'and the founder never did anything to say he was going to do.', \"and then hired a bunch of devs that didn't do what they were going to do.\", 'and every time i gave advice, the advice was i was going to fucking fuck.', \"so there's not anything illegal about that.\", 'antiquely, argument.', 'the rest that logan did to me was antiquely, gone and illegal.',

crypto zoo where our lead developer took the code that he made, fled switzerland, actually fled switzerland and held it hostage for a million dollars.', 'you never really never gave me anything i will

going to start by going through leaked text messages of the crypto zoo team to understand all of their motivation.\", \"then we'll go to blockchain, evidence and show who sold what.\", \"and finally, we'll confront some of the people responsible.\", 'but before we can do any of that, we have to start in march of 2021.', 'six months before the token even launched, our four suspects, logan, crypto king, eddie and jeff are in a group chat discussing crypto zoo, which starts as a copy of something else.', 'quote, i like imitating crypto kiddies.', 'jake, the crypto king says, logan replies, i agree.', \"and initially, it wasn't called crypto zoo at all.\", 'it was called crypto pets.', \"and they were going to sell a pet's token.\", 'and pretty early on it became clear, this was all about money.', 'how they were going to sell this thing to investors.', 'in fact, crypto king said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars and only six months, saying the range is insane.', '20 to 210 million dollars.', \"it's beautiful wherever we land.\", 'eddie jumped in at this point and talked about how he could sell the project as an investment to a friend matt higgins, saying, quote, he has to spend that $350 million somewhere.', 'why not us?', 'and logan says, i love that idea.', \"crypto king, i'm in.\", \"and of course you have jeff saying, let's go.\", \"so you can see right there, they wanted to sell this game before it didn't even launch.\", 'now later, eddie amends the list of investors and says, quote, investors will be gary vee, todd morley, james altature, ryan kavanaugh, and others confirmed on my end.', 'supposedly, they had a hundred million dollars of investment interest.', 'now, i actually went to some of these investors and asked if this was true.', 'and the one person who responded denied it, ryan kavanaugh.', 'quote, nope, not even a little bit.', 'so this looks like it could be yet another lie from eddie ibanez.', 'but either way, it looks like there was more issues than just finding investors because the team wanted to pre-sell tokens.', 'and not everyone was sure it would be legal.', 'jake the crypto king mentions that quote, if we have a pre-sell, it opens us up to sec issues.', \"and jeff agrees and says, don't want to do anything that brings the sec eyeballs.\", 'now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though.', 'logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins.', 'eddie agrees, he says, you absolutely can do it.', 'i have the sec down, private and pre-sell.', 'and honestly, it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money.', 'you know, do a pre-sale, make millions, but you know, you have these potential legal issues.', \"don't do it, you make less money.\", 'so crypto king comes up with a middle solution.', \"he says, if we can't sell, no pre-sale.\", 'we can still trade them in the liquidity pool.', 'and this is the start of a new disaster, which takes a bit of explaining.', \"now just to work clear, a pre-sale is where you sell investors coins, usually at a discount before you've launched.\", 'and then when you launch, you give them those coins.', \"now like i said, the team didn't want to do that.\", 'so what they did instead was they bought the tokens on the open market right after launch.', \"but they tried to get clever with it because they didn't actually announce that they were launching this coin at all.\", \"they still launched it on june 11th and didn't announce this token through logan until august 18th.\", 'meaning they had all that time to silently buy up as much of the supply at a steep discount as they wanted.', 'and the idea here was that doing this, the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply, which is kind of like a pre-sale, but you know, without all the sec troubles.', 'and crypto king makes this clear on june 7th when he says, quote, launch of the liquidity pool is where huge money will be made because you get in cheaper.', 'and then says, we, the team, begin buying out the liquidity pool.', 'once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying, we send the contract address to friends, family, investors, who want to be able to get in.', 'so obviously the plan is we buy first, then we give it to our close friends and family, and then maybe the public eventually, right?', 'and even the day before, crypto king reminds everyone, quote, zude is tomorrow.', 'i highly recommend everyone get a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in zoom when it goes live.', 'it will likely tend to a thousand x.', 'so that was their plan.', \"rather than doing a pre-sale, they're going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way, but without all the legal troubles.\", 'or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day, this is where things first started to go wrong for the team.', 'at first, everything seemed to go normal.', 'the team sat in a circle and literally bought it out as planned.', 'but the next day, crypto king says something odd.', \"quote, a bot is playing with our token, kind of cool to watch them work, but he doesn't mention who this bot is.\", \"and he also says the a**hole finished selling, but doesn't mention who that is.\", \"now jeff logan's manager replies upset.\", 'he says, how do we prevent someone doing what they just did again?', 'we went from on 130 million to 26 million dollar mark cap in two hours.', \"it's not cool to watch.\", 'logan jumps in.', 'yeah, wait, how did that happen?', 'and he also says what a**hole?', 'how did anyone get this token except for us and none of us sold?', \"and i think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what logan's saying is, hey, we tried to scheme this really well.\", 'we tried to all buy this without letting anyone know.', 'how did this, how did anyone else figure out we were buying it?', 'right?', \"and this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting.\", 'crypto king deflects the question by saying, my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and logan says, no bro, f your buyer.', 'explain to me what just happened and how there were 30 token holders.', 'and jake tries to explain that this was just traders and bots happening to find the token.', 'but logan says only five of us knew about it.', 'jake says, well, many people chased volume and knew tokens.', \"and in some extent he's kind of right.\", \"but logan replies, cap, he doesn't believe him.\", \"quote, i can't be the only one who thinks that's too incredibly convenient.\", 'like someone was tipped off.', \"and look, no one's more critical of logan than me.\", \"but as i'm reading these texts, i was kind of like agreeing.\", \"like, yeah, it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot.\", 'you know what i mean?', 'because crypto king was acting very strange.', 'he says, we created 40 million dollars out of thin air.', 'this is a success.', 'logan replies, this nonchalant worries me.', 'f 40 million, it was at 120 million.', \"which again, it's all about the money with these guys.\", \"but truth be told, i did agree that crypto king's attitude seems strange in these texts.\", \"i mean, he's not wrong that bots are a thing.\", 'traders are a thing.', \"but it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it.\", 'so naturally, i looked into it.', 'and what i found surprised me, because there were bots.', \"but there's also unusual human activity during this time.\", 'so i tracked the five biggest buyers of the zoo coin.', 'and lo and behold, this is what i found.', \"logan was one of the biggest buyers, which is what you'd expect.\", \"but he wasn't the biggest.\", 'in fact, two of the biggest wallets seem to be associated with crypto king himself.', \"and here's where i pause.\", 'i said, wait a second.', \"why did this guy buy more zoo tokens than logan when this is mostly logan's project?\", 'i thought crypto king was a small part of this team.', 'and so, to get more info on this, i actually got access to an internal meeting note from the day of june 11, which they called zoo day.', 'and in it, we find actually some interesting information.', 'we see that five founders bought in.', 'they apparently were, quote, trading in circles until each person maxed out.', 'but on the list of buyers and how much they spend are only four people.', \"when we know five people bought, we have danny, logan's assistant for 20k, logan paul for 100k, jeff at 100k, and eddie at 100k, but crypto king is nowhere to be found.\", 'and yet, on the blockchain, i have him putting in $200,000 worth.', 'and this number, by the way, seemingly is confirmed in a conversation i had with crypto king, where he said, my 200k investment.', 'and the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch.', 'because crypto king had a relatively small role in this whole project.', \"he was the advisor, but it wasn't that big of a deal.\", 'like you can see from the internal meeting notes.', \"they have a breakdown of who's getting what in terms of founder tokens.\", \"and like logan paul's getting 51% and he's getting 30%, jeff's getting 10%.\", \"jake's only getting 5% of tokens.\", 'but he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens, which makes no sense.', \"and it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like, oh, don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch.\", \"maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token.\", 'maybe he was buying it to sell later.', \"now of course, that's speculation.\", \"so that's why i confronted crypto king on all of this.\", \"but before we get to that call, let's address the elephant in the room.\", \"logan didn't accuse crypto king of being a scam.\", 'it was the other way around.', 'crypto king told logan paul he was a scammer.', 'and the question is why?', 'well, to answer that, we have to go from june, the stealth launch date, to september 1st, the official launch date of crypto zoo.', 'september 1st, crypto zoo dot co. now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think, well, they already have a token, right?', 'but the first thing they did was actually create a new zoo token with a different code, but the same name.', 'and they actually air dropped all the holders of the first zoo token with an identical amount of those coins on the second zoo token.', 'so you might be wondering why did they do that?', \"well, maybe it's to change the smart contract, but maybe it's because of what they did do.\", 'they blacklisted some of the holders.', \"in other words, they didn't air drop to everyone, including jake the crypto king.\", \"they excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins.\", 'jake texted the group about this the next day, saying, quote, the zoo team made a major error this weekend.', 'they chose not to communicate, meant a new token, and air drop it to whatever wallets they determined fit.', 'this decision came from eddie and logan, and i had no partner.', '11,250 wallets before the air drop under 11,000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets.', 'now who those wallets are, i have no idea.', 'but he continues quote, as a founder, like logan, jeff, eddie and danny, i had purchased a large quantity of tokens.', \"five plus of my wallets had been blacklisted from the original team's boss.\", \"i don't know why he had five wall, five plus wallets there, but okay, okay.\", 'he says 80 plus billion zoo tokens were confiscated from me to date without any communication.', \"so wow, that's why crypto king accused logan of stealing from him or scamming.\", \"it's because he was frozen out of a lot of his wallets.\", \"then we get to the text, you guys all know, he says logan, you stole $40 million, you're a scammer, you're a con artist, all that stuff.\", 'you betrayed your community.', \"the reality is you aren't that guy.\", 'and logan responds, oh, jake, trust me, bro, i am that guy.', 'queue in the arms of an angel.', 'and look, i mean, what do we make of this?', \"well, i don't know, i can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like logan stabbed him in the back.\", 'but it sounds like crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place, right?', \"because it does appear like he bought tokens that maybe everyone didn't know about.\", \"so i'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation.\", 'and by the way, this whole thing was structured so misleadingly from the beginning.', 'i have to talk to you a bit about it because you might think that these tokens were the only tokens they had.', \"but it's not even true.\", \"in the distribution section of zoos white paper, they say there's two trillion tokens.\", 'and a quarter of that are allocated to development, marketing, and founders.', \"those aren't even the tokens we're talking about right now.\", 'because they claim that those tokens were locked up for six months.', 'and then afterwards, 10% was unlocked every month.', \"and if that's true, there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted, right?\", 'why would you blacklist something that would be locked up?', 'and the answer is because, well, the founders had more than one set of tokens.', \"not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold, these stealth launch tokens were different from that.\", \"it's like a whole different thing.\", \"and the tokens that they bought, that all of these guys bought, they could sell it basically any time because they weren't locked up, which is a massive problem.\", 'and this fact was explicitly laid out in their meeting notes with only one rule.', 'they say, quote, no selling until $200 million market cap.', \"and don't impact the market more than 3%, and not impact the market more than 10% in a day.\", 'and by the way, this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market.', 'they literally have an insider rules for how to sell.', \"but we're going to not even, we're going to look past that, right?\", 'because these rules eventually kind of changed.', \"a text from logan's manager, jeff levin, came to the group chat, zoo founders, saying, guys, new and absolute rules.\", 'no one is to sell or transfer any zoo.', \"logan's going to make the call when we can make moves.\", 'logan replies, your tokens do not leave your wallet.', 'this is a game.', 'now, that all sounds well and good.', \"don't sell your tokens.\", \"don't sell your tokens.\", \"but the reality was, i mean, they're just kind of trusting each other.\", \"because these tokens that they're talking about, they're unlocked.\", \"they're not locked up.\", 'and they could sell it at any time.', \"and i guess the question on my mind is, is that why crypto king's tokens were blacklisted?\", 'because they thought he would sell?', \"or maybe it's just the fact they found out he bought, and they didn't know about all those tokens.\", \"it's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence.\", \"and this is where we're going to jump into the blockchain.\", \"now, i've tracked the wallets of the entire team, and identified the largest seller of zoo in the team.\", \"and it wasn't jeff.\", \"it wasn't danny.\", \"it wasn't even logan.\", 'it was crypto king.', 'crypto king sold by my calculations millions of dollars.', \"and i know what you're thinking.\", \"how's that possible, right?\", 'i thought his tokens were blacklisted the day of the official launch.', 'how could he sell that much?', 'well, the answer is that not all of his tokens were blacklisted.', 'he had even more tokens behind the scenes.', \"and what's worse, the crypto's new team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens, which i guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing, because he then turned around and sold those tokens, right?\", 'and from my blockchain analysis across his blacklisted tokens he got back, and the tokens that he had scrolled away the whole time, he ended up making $6 million.', 'he did this by sending out tokens from these larger wallets to dozens of smaller wallets, selling it, and then sending the money to final cash out wallets.', 'so i used those final wallets to calculate the amount he made.', \"now, i know, look, it's a lot to accuse someone of selling $6 million in a project that doesn't even work to giant scam.\", 'so i wanted to give him a chance to defend himself.', 'so i got him a call with crypto king.', \"and here's what he said when i finally revealed that i knew he had sold.\", \"it's going to take so long to be story.\", \"yeah, i'll go on the record for you.\", \"and yes, i'm going to show you the cash message that said we can sell at these ascending market caps.\", \"i'm just 100% it sounds like your biggest issue with me is that i sold.\", \"and if that's your biggest issue with me, that's the truth.\", 'wow, that is a big admission.', \"selling tokens for a project that you're an advisor on when the project has never been delivered.\", \"although crypto king insists that it wasn't $6 million and he wasn't trying to rug a project.\", 'in fact, you know, really he might be the one who got screwed over on all of this.', \"i did sell i didn't sell $6 million worth.\", \"that's going to be other wallets, but that's probably not going to be me being proven.\", \"except for them saying can you send b&b to all these different wallets for me, which then i'll be able to show you that i was giving me the whole thing.\", \"i'll also be able to show you that i was a 5% holder of these tokens that i was promised to be given over the three month period.\", 'just never give it.', 'i can also show you that i was frozen out.', 'i was never given the 15 billion tokens back that i paid for in cash.', \"i'll show you all of those things on the record.\", 'and then you can also say that i did sell, which is also true.', \"as long as it's a company with people as they founders that was supposed to be in 5% of the project and was never given the token or paid or for almost a year on the project.\", \"as long as that goes in with it, then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like i was trying to rug a project.\", \"it's like i put $250,000 into a project plus six months of time.\", 'and the founder never did anything that he said he was going to do and then hired a bunch of devs that went into what they were going to do.', 'and every time i gave advice, the advice was i was supposed to pop off.', \"so it can be that story or it can be he sold all this amount and he got in or well, yeah, that's like 1% of it.\", 'incredible.', 'he sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too.', 'which just has to win the gold medal for me for mental gymnastics because i mean, he literally had put $200,000 into this and he says he made millions of dollars.', \"even if you take him at his word that he didn't make the full 6 million, he admits to me later that it might be a pretty close guess.\", \"he tells me via text quote, i don't care if you tell people i sold a few million and leave it at that.\", \"well, okay, $6 million, a few million dollars, it's millions of dollars, right?\", \"millions of dollars when you only put in $200,000 into a project that's never been delivered, doesn't work, scam people out of their money.\", \"how is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong?\", 'well, in his view, what he did was not wrong.', \"it might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal.\", 'and what logan did, well, that was illegal.', 'you can say the timing was bad and it was inappropriate to sell.', \"but the reality is i've bought tokens open market and sold them open market.\", \"so there's nothing illegal about that.\", 'ascically, archival, the rest that logan did to me was ascically teed from and illegal.', 'now, what do i think of all this finger pointing?', \"well, i think it's pretty wild to try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions.\", 'i just do.', 'now at the same time, i want to be fair to cryptokin.', \"he's not the only one who sold here.\", 'but i also have to say not everyone from the founders did sell.', \"for example, jeff logan's manager to my knowledge never sold.\", 'neither did logan paul, which was a huge surprise.', 'all their walls that i tracked, you know, held onto their tokens, which is good.', \"and to their credit for a game that doesn't work.\", 'but you know who did sell?', 'eddie ibanez.', \"the guy who didn't pay the initial devs, the supposed mit orphan?\", 'yeah, from what i could see, his initial wall had got a ton of zoo, sent it to a bunch of smaller wallets, and then sold off.', 'kind of like cryptokin.', 'and for my calculations, he made about $1.7 million.', 'now, i have to tell you that like jake, i tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself.', 'but he never replied to my emails or my phone calls.', \"and we're just going to have to leave it there.\", \"but we're not done with the money just yet.\", 'because we still need to talk about the eggs.', 'remember we talked about how they profited from zoocoin, but they also made millions from eggs.', 'according to their own internal meeting notes, they plan to make about $3 million, selling these eggs for.1 a piece.', \"and that's not far from what i calculated they actually did make, which was about $2.5 million.\", \"in the meeting notes, they say they're going to clear expenses and then do payouts.\", 'but payout who?', \"they don't say.\", \"and these expenses are referencing an earlier note suggesting eddie and logan had both spent $300,000 each, which i'll say is not $1 million.\", \"but okay, we'll give it to him, right?\", \"so they got paid back, there's $600,000, but where does the rest of the money go?\", \"well, on the ethereum side, there's one payout for $364,000 to one wallet.\", 'and another million dollars to another.', \"they both are coinbase addresses, so we don't know who exactly that is.\", 'clearly, someone on the team made a lot of money from these nft egg sales that do not work.', 'and on the binance smart chain side where they also made money selling eggs, the zoo that was spent was supposed to be set aside for 50% to be burned, which they did.', 'but the other 50% was supposed to be allocated for wildlife charities and crypto zoo development.', \"now, neither seems to have happened because all the money is in a wallet that the team still controls, so they're open questions about, you know, where that money is going to go.\", 'and where the ethereum money went?', 'did it go to jake?', 'did it go to logan?', 'did it go to jeff?', 'did it go to eddie?', \"we don't know.\", 'but what i know for sure is that no one was innocent, although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about.', 'because, of course, not everyone did sell.', 'you could look at that as the most important thing.', \"logan paul didn't sell.\", \"jeff, logan's manager didn't sell.\", 'but does that make them innocent?', \"well, i don't think so, because they never built a game they promised people.\", 'logan paul specifically got millions of dollars spent on this game on the promise of the technology that he never built, that his team never built.', \"and he never addressed the failure, except to blame his developers who weren't paid.\", 'and you could say he promised to work backwards to fix it, but then never did.', \"but at the same time, it's clearly not just logan's fault either, because there are major team issues, right?\", \"you've got eddie selling millions of dollars of zoo, and then allegedly not paying developers.\", \"you've got jeff, who was warned about eddie, who kept him on the team anyways.\", 'and then after they fired eddie, seems to also have failed to pay developers on time.', \"and then you've got crypto king himself, who sold the most.\", \"but claims he was the guy who was scammed, which is the stupidest thing i've ever heard.\", \"it's just like a vinger's assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto game.\", 'and so unsurprisingly, it turns out a lot of these guys backstabbed each other.', \"and so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult, because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame.\", 'because if you focus on any one person, you kind of miss why this project failed.', 'crypto zoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low.', 'crypto zoo failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised.', 'really, the number one problem, even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens, was that they never paid the developers on time, as boring as that is.', \"and as a result, the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars, which is a problem, but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning, which was not a crypto project, but something different.\", \"i'm excited to watch my game.\", 'you keep using it again.', 'you keep using a word there.', 'game.', \"you're not using like a project.\", \"it's a game.\", \"it's a game.\", \"it's a really fun game that makes you money.\", \"that's it.\", 'that to me is the biggest scam in all of this.', \"yes, it's a huge problem.\", \"people stole millions of dollars, but it's a symptom of the larger issue, which is people didn't actually care about the game or whatever you want to call it.\", 'they just cared about the money.', 'and this is ultimately what happens when you have an influencer, larping as a businessman.', \"it's what happens when you have a liar, larping as a developer, and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru, larping as a crypto king.\", 'you end up with a mess, and in my personal opinion, a fraud as well.', 'and now that this thing blew up in their faces, these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than sbf dodges calls with me.', 'because i have reached out to everyone involved.', \"i've tried to get all of their statements on things.\", 'so far, no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all.', \"they're all hiding.\", \"pretending these victims don't even exist.\", 'but they do exist.', \"and throughout my investigations, they've been the heartbeat of this whole thing.\", 'so i decided to close this investigations in a bit of a unique way.', \"rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think, i want to give them the last word.\", \"everyone's to blame.\", 'logan, in the sense of his name is called management, his head project.', 'he still made these promises to people.', 'i think everyone it is to blame, including logan paul, of course, because he was the one in charge of this.', 'and he was responsible for all of this mess.', 'everybody has a big part and a massive, massive cross-to-bear.', 'each one of them scanned the project in their own way, and then off.', 'the sun suddenly went.', 'it was his job to check the team to make sure that everyone is working together to make sure that he is giving the funds of the people that put it into his project under his name to people that he actually trust.', \"so in my opinion, if the team failed to perform, that's logan paul to blame.\", 'the communities destroyed.', 'people is angry.', 'they just want their money back.', 'they just want their normal life back.', 'reimbursed, reimbursed those loyal fans that they have, or had to rebuild the project, actually deliver on the project for those who are so holding their eggs like i am.', 'for those holding the zoo coins, so maybe they could just deliver what they promised, and that would give some redemption to this piascal.', \"he's not said a word.\", \"that's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money.\", \"it's not coming out and just being a man about it.\", 'at least we deserve to know what was happening behind the scenes while we were waiting for almost a year and a half.', \"the fact that we're hearing this information not from an involved but from pretty much a investigator, it really says a lot.\", 'what did this last mean to me?', 'it meant a lot, not just personally because i lost quite a lot of money in my kid and also my wife were invested.', \"it was like telling a kid that santa doesn't exist or something like that because she really believed in all that game.\", 'she really believed in logan paul.', 'kids look up to that kind of people.', 'so it was some kind of broken dream.', 'my mother had got a mum, my mum was invested.', 'my sister was also invested.', \"so i mean my daughter even had a couple of the eggs and animals which the lost for them hurts the most because obviously she's not nice to see.\", 'to somebody to win, somebody has to lose.', \"that's a gamble you take whether you get into crypto or not.\", 'i got in knowing that i could lose.', 'which is fine.', \"that's on me.\", 'but i thought if i lost something it would be because i sold it the wrong time.', \"or the game didn't earn as much as i thought it would and therefore my fingers were earn as valuable.\", \"but i never, you never go into it thinking it's not something that they're going to just sell out from underneath you because they could make so much more.\", 'if they actually delivered on what they said, even if they delivered on close to what they said.', \"and that's the thing is you don't think they're going to rugby because there was so much money in a game wallet.\", 'ultimately at the end the way i see it is it was fraud.', 'love and could have could have put out the red flags.', 'all people would stop investing more into it because people were invested.', 'people were still investing to this project and to the very last minute where the ship was still just sinking down the ocean and people were still putting their cash into it.', 'if i was on a cold, logan paul, i would ask him where did his redemption art go.', 'i think he was on such a good streak going about his youtube career and boxing as well.', \"and it's sad to see that because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his youths.\", 'what would i say to logan paul and his team if i pulled?', 'well actually i cool because i have an nft from other projects that gives me the right to see logan paul to meet and greet with him.', 'and i will actually use that right to tell him this story again.', 'show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family, my whole family and my kids are affected with this situation.', \"because i think that's what he would think.\", 'you would think that logan would have told his fellow followers, his loyal fans, that hey guys back off, red flag, things are turbulence in the water.', 'no, not a single word, nothing.', 'what sort of...', 'i think that is inhumane the way that that side of us has been marketed.', \"knowing what's happened since, knowing that all of the people that were there from the beginning, like all of the guys that i'd speak to on a daily basis that we've all just got nothing now.\", \"ideally i just want to say i'll see you in

          "which, by the way, seems incredibly ironic, given just how much logan winds about not being paid by floyd mayweather.",
          "where's my money, bitch?",
          "flood never paid me for our fight.",
          "now, in all seriousness, i do want to acknowledge something which actually kind of looks bad a bit on the developers because it turns out very few written contracts were actually done.",
          "but that's when communication broke down.",
          "this is where i think the dev guys screwed up and led to this whole situation of like, okay, we're just going to take the code private until you pay us for our work.",
          "i'm just playing devils advocate and saying, this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail and writing.",

          "why not pay for a game that now isn't launched and now investors are so angry about?",

          "i first realized eddie might be lying to me when i went home the next day and googled eddie ibanez's family.",
          "hold, it turns out the only problem with that is that not only does his mom exist, she's alive and in his life.",
          "how did he swear that with you?",
          "but as insane as these lies are, let's be real.",
          "it doesn't explain why cryptos who failed.",
          "but the next lies kind of do because part of eddie's story is also that he went to mit where he was recruited to the cia.",
          "but it's just not true.",
          "that's right, the whole orphan to mit origin story, it wasn't true.",
          "if this is all seeming crazy to you, you might ask yourself who would believe all this?",
          "he kind of had a gift for getting people to believe in the lies he told.",
          "they get at certain fatigue levels.",
          "and every time you get hit, that red bar goes down until you die.",
          "and on an injury level, right, there's injury part of it.",
          "it's back down and that gets chaos.",
          "this is insane.",
          "and of course, none of it's true.",
          "meaning there's no way this story is true.",
          "he's not like ever grabbed you or anything like that.",
          "he also used his other connections, his real millionaire and billionaire friends that he's managed to gain with all these fake stories.",
          "i found out crypto zoo did have an advantage that could have saved them all this trouble the whole time.",
          "and after he spoke fondly of eddie and his work, i confronted him about some of eddie's lies, including how he didn't work for the nfl.",
          "okay, because i had trouble with some of that, like, with the nfl, like saying that, like, no, we've never worked with him.",
          "this is just unbelievable, willful stupidity.",
          "so let's add him to the conspiracy board.",
          "because i don't want it to ever be thought that logan's the reason it felt.",
          "logan wasn't smart enough for what he tried to build.",
          "and then when it was built and was failing, didn't have the ability to correct it.",
          "and to save face and reputation, it was more convenient to pull out than to be associated with the failing project that the dev rock.",
          "cryptoking says it's all eddie's fault.",
          "you know, eddie ruined everything because yeah, eddie is a liar.",
          "so it does seem to explain how these developers got screwed.",
          "but this theory doesn't fit all the facts because eddie was kicked off the team months ago.",
          "despite logan claiming they were going to go back and fix all the problems.",
          "working backwards to fix things, which isn't ideal.",
          "what's worse, is the newest dev team who came on after eddie just quit.",
          "paying block ops, the company they hired out on july 19th.",
          "and this is just the same problem as before, slightly different.",
          "nobody can pay these devs on time and investors end up getting nothing.",
          "and so i can't buy into the idea that eddie's at fault for everything.",
          "because when eddie was gone, they had a lot of the same problems.",
          "now, it was only at the point that this dev team quit block ops that things really took a turn.",
          "you know, from every direction, i started getting messages from all the investors who felt betrayed, who up to this point were holding on to hope.",
          "now they felt defeated.",
          "they felt tricked by the cryptozoo team who had fed them promise after promise.",
          "and they were sick of it.",
          "he was never in each other, and he didn't ever apologize to her or just anything.",
          "but i believe nobody has to lose money in this way.",
          "they decided to leak me messages, team messages from the cryptozoo team from all the way back in the beginning when they thought of this idea all the way up to launch.",
          "remember how jake, the crypto king, said eddie was the only problem?",
          "you are a scam artist.",
          "you are a liar, and you betrayed your own community.",
          "and it's not like i was trying to applaud the project.",
          "and every time i gave advice, the advice was i was going to fucking fuck.",
          "antiquely, argument.",
          "the rest that logan did to me was antiquely, gone and illegal.",
          "this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.",
          "so far, we've discovered fake orphans, millions of dollars stolen and a cast of sleazy characters, but now it's time to put it all together.",
          "and who's to blame?",
          "we're going to start by going through leaked text messages of the crypto zoo team to understand all of their motivation.",
          "and finally, we'll confront some of the people responsible.",
          "six months before the token even launched, our four suspects, logan, crypto king, eddie and jeff are in a group chat discussing crypto zoo, which starts as a copy of something else.",
          "in fact, crypto king said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars and only six months, saying the range is insane.",
          "and the one person who responded denied it, ryan kavanaugh.",
          "and not everyone was sure it would be legal.",
          "and jeff agrees and says, don't want to do anything that brings the sec eyeballs.",
          "now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though.",
          "logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins.",
          "and honestly, it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money.",
          "and this is the start of a new disaster, which takes a bit of explaining.",
          "now like i said, the team didn't want to do that.",
          "and the idea here was that doing this, the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply, which is kind of like a pre-sale, but you know, without all the sec troubles.",
          "once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying, we send the contract address to friends, family, investors, who want to be able to get in.",
          "rather than doing a pre-sale, they're going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way, but without all the legal troubles.",
          "or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day, this is where things first started to go wrong for the team.",
          "but the next day, crypto king says something odd.",
          "now jeff logan's manager replies upset.",
          "it's not cool to watch.",
          "and i think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what logan's saying is, hey, we tried to scheme this really well.",
          "and this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting.",
          "crypto king deflects the question by saying, my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and logan says, no bro, f your buyer.",
          "and look, no one's more critical of logan than me.",
          "like, yeah, it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot.",
          "because crypto king was acting very strange.",
          "logan replies, this nonchalant worries me.",
          "but truth be told, i did agree that crypto king's attitude seems strange in these texts.",
          "but it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it.",
          "and the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch.",
          "but he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens, which makes no sense.",
          "and it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like, oh, don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch.",
          "maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token.",
          "so that's why i confronted crypto king on all of this.",
          "logan didn't accuse crypto king of being a scam.",
          "well, to answer that, we have to go from june, the stealth launch date, to september 1st, the official launch date of crypto zoo.",
          "september 1st, crypto zoo dot co. now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think, well, they already have a token, right?",
          "they excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins.",
          "jake texted the group about this the next day, saying, quote, the zoo team made a major error this weekend.",
          "they chose not to communicate, meant a new token, and air drop it to whatever wallets they determined fit.",
          "this decision came from eddie and logan, and i had no partner.",
          "11,250 wallets before the air drop under 11,000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets.",
          "now who those wallets are, i have no idea.",
          "so wow, that's why crypto king accused logan of stealing from him or scamming.",
          "you betrayed your community.",
          "well, i don't know, i can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like logan stabbed him in the back.",
          "but it sounds like crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place, right?",
          "so i'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation.",
          "but it's not even true.",
          "and if that's true, there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted, right?",
          "not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold, these stealth launch tokens were different from that.",
          "and the tokens that they bought, that all of these guys bought, they could sell it basically any time because they weren't locked up, which is a massive problem.",
          "they say, quote, no selling until $200 million market cap.",
          "and by the way, this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market.",
          "no one is to sell or transfer any zoo.",
          "it's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence.",
          "and what's worse, the crypto's new team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens, which i guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing, because he then turned around and sold those tokens, right?",
          "now, i know, look, it's a lot to accuse someone of selling $6 million in a project that doesn't even work to giant scam.",
          "in fact, you know, really he might be the one who got screwed over on all of this.",
          "as long as that goes in with it, then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like i was trying to rug a project.",
          "he sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too.",
          "he tells me via text quote, i don't care if you tell people i sold a few million and leave it at that.",
          "how is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong?",
          "it might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal.",
          "and what logan did, well, that was illegal.",
          "you can say the timing was bad and it was inappropriate to sell.",
          "ascically, archival, the rest that logan did to me was ascically teed from and illegal.",
          "well, i think it's pretty wild to try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions.",
          "now, i have to tell you that like jake, i tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself.",
          "and we're just going to have to leave it there.",
          "but what i know for sure is that no one was innocent, although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about.",
          "and he never addressed the failure, except to blame his developers who weren't paid.",
          "you've got jeff, who was warned about eddie, who kept him on the team anyways.",
          "and then after they fired eddie, seems to also have failed to pay developers on time.",
          "but claims he was the guy who was scammed, which is the stupidest thing i've ever heard.",
          "it's just like a vinger's assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto game.",
          "and so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult, because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame.",
          "because if you focus on any one person, you kind of miss why this project failed.",
          "crypto zoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low.",
          "crypto zoo failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised.",
          "really, the number one problem, even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens, was that they never paid the developers on time, as boring as that is.",
          "and as a result, the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars, which is a problem, but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning, which was not a crypto project, but something different.",
          "you're not using like a project.",
          "that to me is the biggest scam in all of this.",
          "yes, it's a huge problem.",
          "people stole millions of dollars, but it's a symptom of the larger issue, which is people didn't actually care about the game or whatever you want to call it.",
          "it's what happens when you have a liar, larping as a developer, and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru, larping as a crypto king.",
          "you end up with a mess, and in my personal opinion, a fraud as well.",
          "and now that this thing blew up in their faces, these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than sbf dodges calls with me.",
          "so far, no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all.",
          "they're all hiding.",
          "pretending these victims don't even exist.",
          "rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think, i want to give them the last word.",
          "everyone's to blame.",
          "i think everyone it is to blame, including logan paul, of course, because he was the one in charge of this.",
          "and he was responsible for all of this mess.",
          "so in my opinion, if the team failed to perform, that's logan paul to blame.",
          "the communities destroyed.",
          "people is angry.",
          "that's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money.",
          "it meant a lot, not just personally because i lost quite a lot of money in my kid and also my wife were invested.",
          "so it was some kind of broken dream.",
          "so i mean my daughter even had a couple of the eggs and animals which the lost for them hurts the most because obviously she's not nice to see.",
          "to somebody to win, somebody has to lose.",
          "i got in knowing that i could lose.",
          "but i thought if i lost something it would be because i sold it the wrong time.",
          "ultimately at the end the way i see it is it was fraud.",
          "all people would stop investing more into it because people were invested.",
          "and it's sad to see that because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his youths.",
          "show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family, my whole family and my kids are affected with this situation.",

got finished roasting logan for a different coin called dinkdunk, which his fans lost money on.\",\"now look, i know logan's friends tried to make it look like dinkdunk was all about the memes, but it

handmade art story wasn't really true.\",\"you know, is he lying?\",\"there's no way he expects people to believe he's spent it on art.\",\"it's not even original.\",\"now at the time i'm looking into this, there's a teaser going around for hatch day, which is the day you can hatch your egg in fts.\",\"only for the worse.\",\"let's meet one of the victims, helicopter bob, to explain more.\",\"my name is rob, helicopter bob lost just under $7,000 with crypto zoo.\",\"there was no way to claim your yield.\",\"there was no way to claim your yield.\",\"the core mechanic of crypto zoo that you can make money with these stupid animals didn't even work on launch day.\",\"which this is just crazy.\",\"but it even gets worse because i kept talking to people and i discovered something.\",\"i must be doing something wrong.\",\"oh yeah, no, no, it's down for the moment, but we're working on it.\",\"no, i'm telling you, it's just a picture.\",\"no more podcast mentions.\",\"no more saying he hand made art.\",\"crypto zoo already got millions in investments, but logan only speaks in the discord twice over the next year.\",\"to say, quote, sober, currently shaking my head.\",\"he told people things like, logan is an uncontrollable marketing guru.\",\"and marketing will crush.\",\"and this disconnect between logan abandoning the project and his team on crypto zoo saying that he hadn't saying that it was going to be any day now.\",\"i'm abandoning it or whatever before people go on the track and promising and promising.\",\"how some decency to come out talk to the people that invested initially, that invested along the way on all of the fake and false promises, on all of the false hype and be honest with people.\",\"and it's because of these false promises about marketing, that these poor investors believed in crypto zoo so long they sat, and watched every logan ball up as a trying to guess and decipher when this so-called marketing push would happen.\",\"only a month after crypto zoo's launch, actually, the hatch day, they started teasing this.\",\"no, no, no, no.\",\"this is going to be, yeah, this is going to be crazy.\",\"and he's like, no, no, no, no, definitely, definitely not.\",\"it's the bad actors who ruined the project.\",\"and you know there's accusations out there.\",\"it's sad because of what i just said.\",\"like any burgeoning industry, if there's money to be made, there's going to be both good and bad people.\",\"like behind the scenes drama that took a stick and stuck it in the spokes of my wheels.\",\"i mean, isn't the mystery solved?\",\"why did he steal logan's code for a million dollars?\",\"however, i finally got a hold of him and when i did, he admitted he took the code hostage but he says the reason for it was nothing like what logan had said.\",\"and you've got to point what i was working on and what i just realized was that i was trying to steal all of my work.\",\"and the only thing they brought today was the first stop.\",\"now, i didn't want to just take one person's word for it.\",\"now, obviously, these are big accusations, which is why i wanted to confront logan paul on them.\",\"unfortunately, we're not exactly on speaking terms.\",\"hey, sorry to bother you.\",\"i have no comment for it.\",\"okay, you're are you guys denying it?\",\"are you saying it's not true?\",\"no comment.\",\"so i mean, it's pretty serious accusation.\",\"and obviously i don't want to just run a story.\",\"as we've been advised always is if anybody reports fake news.\",\"that's where we won't, you know, yeah, this call was a mess.\",\"even though logan can go on podcasts and publicly accuse those developers of stealing his coat.\",\"which he then denies doing when i ask him if that's what he's doing.\",\"told you i'm no comment to it telling you once again from a legal standpoint, you have to report truth.\",\"if you do not verify truth, then you're just allegations.\",\"wait, so you're saying you're saying you refuse to give me proof that the allegations aren't true.\",\"no, no, i did not say that.\",\"i have no comment on the situation.\",\"if you don't report facts on the information you're given, it is illegal.\",\"now, i'm no lawyer, but i don't think it's a crime to say that multiple developers say they haven't been paid.\",\"which, by the way, seems incredibly ironic, given just how much logan winds about not being paid by floyd mayweather.\",\"where's my money, bitch?\",\"flood never paid me for our fight.\",\"now, in all seriousness, i do want to acknowledge something which actually kind of looks bad a bit on the developers because it turns out very few written contracts were actually done.\",\"but that's when communication broke down.\",\"this is where i think the dev guys screwed up and led to this whole situation of like, okay, we're just going to take the code private until you pay us for our work.\",\"i'm just playing devils advocate and saying, this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail and writing.\",\"but if you're thinking that that's the million dollar mystery solved, well, no.\",\"why not pay for a game that now isn't launched and now investors are so angry about?\",\"well, this is where things get even stranger because right when i was ready to pin everything on logan and believe me, he is at fault.\",\"they say they had no communications with logan.\",\"if you leave the developer here, it's crypto zoo.\",\"this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.\",\"you are a scam artist.\",\"you are a liar and you betrayed your own community.\",\"i lost around $50,000 in cryptos.\",\"i lost $40,000.\",\"no.\",\"anything, i'll never ever... eddie promised me, you know, five suit tokens.\",\"as a teenager, he successfully hacked aol from his bedroom.\",\"he was then recruited out to work for a government agency in cyber security, developing software that reverse engineers' location of known government and terrorist threats.\",\"you started with the federal government and you started off really tracking criminals with burn-of-phones and all that.\",\"honestly, after this whole search, i felt more confused than ever.\",\"not good.\",\"well, i'm confused about this eddie ibanez guy.\",\"so, what's the problem?\",\"well, everything's not great.\",\"no wait, i did find something.\",\"this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.\",\"this guy adam rob investigated it.\",\"we met up with adam rob, the reporter who's been investigating eddie ibanez for a while now.\",\"i wasn't quite sure what to make of them.\",\"and i didn't want to waste his time.\",\"and it wasn't long after i sat down that i realized he was wasting my time.\",\"can you tell me about some of the lies eddie told you?\",\"eddie has told me so many lies over the course of my two interviews with him.\",\"i first realized eddie might be lying to me when i went home the next day and googled eddie ibanez's family.\",\"hold, it turns out the only problem with that is that not only does his mom exist, she's alive and in his life.\",\"how did he swear that with you?\",\"but as insane as these lies are, let's be real.\",\"it doesn't explain why cryptos who failed.\",\"but the next lies kind of do because part of eddie's story is also that he went to mit where he was recruited to the cia.\",\"but it's just not true.\",\"that's right, the whole orphan to mit origin story, it wasn't true.\",\"if this is all seeming crazy to you, you might ask yourself who would believe all this?\",\"he kind of had a gift for getting people to believe in the lies he told.\",\"they get at certain fatigue levels.\",\"and every time you get hit, that red bar goes down until you die.\",\"and on an injury level, right, there's injury part of it.\",\"it's back down and that gets chaos.\",\"this is insane.\",\"and of course, none of it's true.\",\"meaning there's no way this story is true.\",\"he's not like ever grabbed you or anything like that.\",\"he also used his other connections, his real millionaire and billionaire friends that he's managed to gain with all these fake stories.\",\"i found out crypto zoo did have an advantage that could have saved them all this trouble the whole time.\",\"and after he spoke fondly of eddie and his work, i confronted him about some of eddie's lies, including how he didn't work for the nfl.\",\"okay, because i had trouble with some of that, like, with the nfl, like saying that, like, no, we've never worked with him.\",\"this is just unbelievable, willful stupidity.\",\"so let's add him to the conspiracy board.\",\"because i don't want it to ever be thought that logan's the reason it felt.\",\"logan wasn't smart enough for what he tried to build.\",\"and then when it was built and was failing, didn't have the ability to correct it.\",\"and to save face and reputation, it was more convenient to pull out than to be associated with the failing project that the dev rock.\",\"cryptoking says it's all eddie's fault.\",\"you know, eddie ruined everything because yeah, eddie is a liar.\",\"so it does seem to explain how these developers got screwed.\",\"but this theory doesn't fit all the facts because eddie was kicked off the team months ago.\",\"despite logan claiming they were going to go back and fix all the problems.\",\"working backwards to fix things, which isn't ideal.\",\"what's worse, is the newest dev team who came on after eddie just quit.\",\"paying block ops, the company they hired out on july 19th.\",\"and this is just the same problem as before, slightly different.\",\"nobody can pay these devs on time and investors end up getting nothing.\",\"and so i can't buy into the idea that eddie's at fault for everything.\",\"because when eddie was gone, they had a lot of the same problems.\",\"now, it was only at the point that this dev team quit block ops that things really took a turn.\",\"you know, from every direction, i started getting messages from all the investors who felt betrayed, who up to this point were holding on to hope.\",\"now they felt defeated.\",\"they felt tricked by the cryptozoo team who had fed them promise after promise.\",\"and they were sick of it.\",\"he was never in each other, and he didn't ever apologize to her or just anything.\",\"but i believe nobody has to lose money in this way.\",\"they decided to leak me messages, team messages from the cryptozoo team from all the way back in the beginning when they thought of this idea all the way up to launch.\",\"remember how jake, the crypto king, said eddie was the only problem?\",\"you are a scam artist.\",\"you are a liar, and you betrayed your own community.\",\"and it's not like i was trying to applaud the project.\",\"and every time i gave advice, the advice was i was going to fucking fuck.\",\"antiquely, argument.\",\"the rest that logan did to me was antiquely, gone and illegal.\",\"this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.\",\"so far, we've discovered fake orphans, millions of dollars stolen and a cast of sleazy characters, but now it's time to put it all together.\",\"and who's to blame?\",\"we're going to start by going through leaked text messages of the crypto zoo team to understand all of their motivation.\",\"and finally, we'll confront some of the people responsible.\",\"six months before the token even launched, our four suspects, logan, crypto king, eddie and jeff are in a group chat discussing crypto zoo, which starts as a copy of something else.\",\"in fact, crypto king said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars and only six months, saying the range is insane.\",\"and the one person who responded denied it, ryan kavanaugh.\",\"and not everyone was sure it would be legal.\",\"and jeff agrees and says, don't want to do anything that brings the sec eyeballs.\",\"now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though.\",\"logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins.\",\"and honestly, it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money.\",\"and this is the start of a new disaster, which takes a bit of explaining.\",\"now like i said, the team didn't want to do that.\",\"and the idea here was that doing this, the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply, which is kind of like a pre-sale, but you know, without all the sec troubles.\",\"once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying, we send the contract address to friends, family, investors, who want to be able to get in.\",\"rather than doing a pre-sale, they're going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way, but without all the legal troubles.\",\"or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day, this is where things first started to go wrong for the team.\",\"but the next day, crypto king says something odd.\",\"now jeff logan's manager replies upset.\",\"it's not cool to watch.\",\"and i think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what logan's saying is, hey, we tried to scheme this really well.\",\"and this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting.\",\"crypto king deflects the question by saying, my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and logan says, no bro, f your buyer.\",\"and look, no one's more critical of logan than me.\",\"like, yeah, it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot.\",\"because crypto king was acting very strange.\",\"logan replies, this nonchalant worries me.\",\"but truth be told, i did agree that crypto king's attitude seems strange in these texts.\",\"but it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it.\",\"and the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch.\",\"but he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens, which makes no sense.\",\"and it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like, oh, don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch.\",\"maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token.\",\"so that's why i confronted crypto king on all of this.\",\"logan didn't accuse crypto king of being a scam.\",\"well, to answer that, we have to go from june, the stealth launch date, to september 1st, the official launch date of crypto zoo.\",\"september 1st, crypto zoo dot co. now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think, well, they already have a token, right?\",\"they excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins.\",\"jake texted the group about this the next day, saying, quote, the zoo team made a major error this weekend.\",\"they chose not to communicate, meant a new token, and air drop it to whatever wallets they determined fit.\",\"this decision came from eddie and logan, and i had no partner.\",\"11,250 wallets before the air drop under 11,000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets.\",\"now who those wallets are, i have no idea.\",\"so wow, that's why crypto king accused logan of stealing from him or scamming.\",\"you betrayed your community.\",\"well, i don't know, i can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like logan stabbed him in the back.\",\"but it sounds like crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place, right?\",\"so i'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation.\",\"but it's not even true.\",\"and if that's true, there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted, right?\",\"not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold, these stealth launch tokens were different from that.\",\"and the tokens that they bought, that all of these guys bought, they could sell it basically any time because they weren't locked up, which is a massive problem.\",\"they say, quote, no selling until $200 million market cap.\",\"and by the way, this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market.\",\"no one is to sell or transfer any zoo.\",\"it's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence.\",\"and what's worse, the crypto's new team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens, which i guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing, because he then turned around and sold those tokens, right?\",\"now, i know, look, it's a lot to accuse someone of selling $6 million in a project that doesn't even work to giant scam.\",\"in fact, you know, really he might be the one who got screwed over on all of this.\",\"as long as that goes in with it, then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like i was trying to rug a project.\",\"he sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too.\",\"he tells me via text quote, i don't care if you tell people i sold a few million and leave it at that.\",\"how is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong?\",\"it might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal.\",\"and what logan did, well, that was illegal.\",\"you can say the timing was bad and it was inappropriate to sell.\",\"ascically, archival, the rest that logan did to me was ascically teed from and illegal.\",\"well, i think it's pretty wild to try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions.\",\"now, i have to tell you that like jake, i tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself.\",\"and we're just going to have to leave it there.\",\"but what i know for sure is that no one was innocent, although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about.\",\"and he never addressed the failure, except to blame his developers who weren't paid.\",\"you've got jeff, who was warned about eddie, who kept him on the team anyways.\",\"and then after they fired eddie, seems to also have failed to pay developers on time.\",\"but claims he was the guy who was scammed, which is the stupidest thing i've ever heard.\",\"it's just like a vinger's assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto game.\",\"and so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult, because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame.\",\"because if you focus on any one person, you kind of miss why this project failed.\",\"crypto zoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low.\",\"crypto zoo failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised.\",\"really, the number one problem, even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens, was that they never paid the developers on time, as boring as that is.\",\"and as a result, the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars, which is a problem, but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning, which was not a crypto project, but something different.\",\"you're not using like a project.\",\"that to me is the biggest scam in all of this.\",\"yes, it's a huge problem.\",\"people stole millions of dollars, but it's a symptom of the larger issue, which is people didn't actually care about the game or whatever you want to call it.\",\"it's what happens when you have a liar, larping as a developer, and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru, larping as a crypto king.\",\"you end up with a mess, and in my personal opinion, a fraud as well.\",\"and now that this thing blew up in their faces, these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than sbf dodges calls with me.\",\"so far, no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all.\",\"they're all hiding.\",\"pretending these victims don't even exist.\",\"rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think, i want to give them the last word.\",\"everyone's to blame.\",\"i think everyone it is to blame, including logan paul, of course, because he was the one in charge of this.\",\"and he was responsible for all of this mess.\",\"so in my opinion, if the team failed to perform, that's logan paul to blame.\",\"the communities destroyed.\",\"people is angry.\",\"that's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money.\",\"it meant a lot, not just personally because i lost quite a lot of money in my kid and also my wife were invested.\",\"so it was some kind of broken dream.\",\"so i mean my daughter even had a couple of the eggs and animals which the lost for them hurts the most because obviously she's not nice to see.\",\"to somebody to win, somebody has to lose.\",\"i got in knowing that i could lose.\",\"but i thought if i lost something it would be because i sold it the wrong time.\",\"ultimately at the end the way i see it is it was fraud.\",\"all people would stop investing more into it because people were invested.\",\"and it's sad to see that because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his youths.\",\"show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family, my whole family and
