i lost around $50,000 in cryptozoo.i lost $40,000.i lost around $15,000 in us dollars.i lost $25,000.no, you haven't!oh, no.i've uncovered sociopaths, billionaires, fake orphans that i mention fake orphans and of course at the center of it we have logan paul himself who has abandoned this thing, leaving thousands of fake orphans in his wake.thousands of victims in his wake.now you'll be hearing from some of those people because their stories are heartbreaking.now look, at first i was just as surprised that this pitch is anyone else, because i just got finished roasting logan for a different coin called dinkdunk, which his fans lost money on.now look, i know logan's friends tried to make it look like dinkdunk was all about the memes, but it turns out they secretly were tied to the project, and logan created the dinkdunk character himself, and subsequently abandoned that project.you're not using like a project, it's a game.you might think, how can i lose?and did i mention the game hadn't even been launched yet?and i know it sounds stupid to buy an influencer project, but you have to understand people saw logan as different.i still believe in this first fight with everyone else that i believe in that.that he was no longer a reckless clout goblin just in it for the money.and come to find out this handmade art story wasn't really true.you know, is he lying?there's no way he expects people to believe he's spent it on art.it's not even original.now at the time i'm looking into this, there's a teaser going around for hatch day, which is the day you can hatch your egg in fts.only for the worse.let's meet one of the victims, helicopter bob, to explain more.my name is rob, helicopter bob lost just under $7,000 with crypto zoo.there was no way to claim your yield.there was no way to claim your yield.the core mechanic of crypto zoo that you can make money with these stupid animals didn't even work on launch day.which this is just crazy.but it even gets worse because i kept talking to people and i discovered something.i must be doing something wrong.oh yeah, no, no, it's down for the moment, but we're working on it.no, i'm telling you, it's just a picture.no more podcast mentions.no more saying he hand made art.crypto zoo already got millions in investments, but logan only speaks in the discord twice over the next year.to say, quote, sober, currently shaking my head.he told people things like, logan is an uncontrollable marketing guru.and marketing will crush.and this disconnect between logan abandoning the project and his team on crypto zoo saying that he hadn't saying that it was going to be any day now.i'm abandoning it or whatever before people go on the track and promising and promising.how some decency to come out talk to the people that invested initially, that invested along the way on all of the fake and false promises, on all of the false hype and be honest with people.and it's because of these false promises about marketing, that these poor investors believed in crypto zoo so long they sat, and watched every logan ball up as a trying to guess and decipher when this so-called marketing push would happen.only a month after crypto zoo's launch, actually, the hatch day, they started teasing this.no, no, no, no.this is going to be, yeah, this is going to be crazy.and he's like, no, no, no, no, definitely, definitely not.it's the bad actors who ruined the project.and you know there's accusations out there.it's sad because of what i just said.like any burgeoning industry, if there's money to be made, there's going to be both good and bad people.like behind the scenes drama that took a stick and stuck it in the spokes of my wheels.i mean, isn't the mystery solved?why did he steal logan's code for a million dollars?however, i finally got a hold of him and when i did, he admitted he took the code hostage but he says the reason for it was nothing like what logan had said.and you've got to point what i was working on and what i just realized was that i was trying to steal all of my work.and the only thing they brought today was the first stop.now, i didn't want to just take one person's word for it.now, obviously, these are big accusations, which is why i wanted to confront logan paul on them.unfortunately, we're not exactly on speaking terms.hey, sorry to bother you.i have no comment for it.okay, you're are you guys denying it?are you saying it's not true?no comment.so i mean, it's pretty serious accusation.and obviously i don't want to just run a story.as we've been advised always is if anybody reports fake news.that's where we won't, you know, yeah, this call was a mess.even though logan can go on podcasts and publicly accuse those developers of stealing his coat.which he then denies doing when i ask him if that's what he's doing.told you i'm no comment to it telling you once again from a legal standpoint, you have to report truth.if you do not verify truth, then you're just allegations.wait, so you're saying you're saying you refuse to give me proof that the allegations aren't true.no, no, i did not say that.i have no comment on the situation.if you don't report facts on the information you're given, it is illegal.now, i'm no lawyer, but i don't think it's a crime to say that multiple developers say they haven't been paid.which, by the way, seems incredibly ironic, given just how much logan winds about not being paid by floyd mayweather.where's my money, bitch?flood never paid me for our fight.now, in all seriousness, i do want to acknowledge something which actually kind of looks bad a bit on the developers because it turns out very few written contracts were actually done.but that's when communication broke down.this is where i think the dev guys screwed up and led to this whole situation of like, okay, we're just going to take the code private until you pay us for our work.i'm just playing devils advocate and saying, this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail and writing.but if you're thinking that that's the million dollar mystery solved, well, no.why not pay for a game that now isn't launched and now investors are so angry about?well, this is where things get even stranger because right when i was ready to pin everything on logan and believe me, he is at fault.they say they had no communications with logan.if you leave the developer here, it's crypto zoo.this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.you are a scam artist.you are a liar and you betrayed your own community.i lost around $50,000 in cryptos.i lost $40,000.no.anything, i'll never ever... eddie promised me, you know, five suit tokens.as a teenager, he successfully hacked aol from his bedroom.he was then recruited out to work for a government agency in cyber security, developing software that reverse engineers' location of known government and terrorist threats.you started with the federal government and you started off really tracking criminals with burn-of-phones and all that.honestly, after this whole search, i felt more confused than ever.not good.well, i'm confused about this eddie ibanez guy.so, what's the problem?well, everything's not great.no wait, i did find something.this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.this guy adam rob investigated it.we met up with adam rob, the reporter who's been investigating eddie ibanez for a while now.i wasn't quite sure what to make of them.and i didn't want to waste his time.and it wasn't long after i sat down that i realized he was wasting my time.can you tell me about some of the lies eddie told you?eddie has told me so many lies over the course of my two interviews with him.i first realized eddie might be lying to me when i went home the next day and googled eddie ibanez's family.hold, it turns out the only problem with that is that not only does his mom exist, she's alive and in his life.how did he swear that with you?but as insane as these lies are, let's be real.it doesn't explain why cryptos who failed.but the next lies kind of do because part of eddie's story is also that he went to mit where he was recruited to the cia.but it's just not true.that's right, the whole orphan to mit origin story, it wasn't true.if this is all seeming crazy to you, you might ask yourself who would believe all this?he kind of had a gift for getting people to believe in the lies he told.they get at certain fatigue levels.and every time you get hit, that red bar goes down until you die.and on an injury level, right, there's injury part of it.it's back down and that gets chaos.this is insane.and of course, none of it's true.meaning there's no way this story is true.he's not like ever grabbed you or anything like that.he also used his other connections, his real millionaire and billionaire friends that he's managed to gain with all these fake stories.i found out crypto zoo did have an advantage that could have saved them all this trouble the whole time.and after he spoke fondly of eddie and his work, i confronted him about some of eddie's lies, including how he didn't work for the nfl.okay, because i had trouble with some of that, like, with the nfl, like saying that, like, no, we've never worked with him.this is just unbelievable, willful stupidity.so let's add him to the conspiracy board.because i don't want it to ever be thought that logan's the reason it felt.logan wasn't smart enough for what he tried to build.and then when it was built and was failing, didn't have the ability to correct it.and to save face and reputation, it was more convenient to pull out than to be associated with the failing project that the dev rock.cryptoking says it's all eddie's fault.you know, eddie ruined everything because yeah, eddie is a liar.so it does seem to explain how these developers got screwed.but this theory doesn't fit all the facts because eddie was kicked off the team months ago.despite logan claiming they were going to go back and fix all the problems.working backwards to fix things, which isn't ideal.what's worse, is the newest dev team who came on after eddie just quit.paying block ops, the company they hired out on july 19th.and this is just the same problem as before, slightly different.nobody can pay these devs on time and investors end up getting nothing.and so i can't buy into the idea that eddie's at fault for everything.because when eddie was gone, they had a lot of the same problems.now, it was only at the point that this dev team quit block ops that things really took a turn.you know, from every direction, i started getting messages from all the investors who felt betrayed, who up to this point were holding on to hope.now they felt defeated.they felt tricked by the cryptozoo team who had fed them promise after promise.and they were sick of it.he was never in each other, and he didn't ever apologize to her or just anything.but i believe nobody has to lose money in this way.they decided to leak me messages, team messages from the cryptozoo team from all the way back in the beginning when they thought of this idea all the way up to launch.remember how jake, the crypto king, said eddie was the only problem?you are a scam artist.you are a liar, and you betrayed your own community.and it's not like i was trying to applaud the project.and every time i gave advice, the advice was i was going to fucking fuck.antiquely, argument.the rest that logan did to me was antiquely, gone and illegal.this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake.so far, we've discovered fake orphans, millions of dollars stolen and a cast of sleazy characters, but now it's time to put it all together.and who's to blame?we're going to start by going through leaked text messages of the crypto zoo team to understand all of their motivation.and finally, we'll confront some of the people responsible.six months before the token even launched, our four suspects, logan, crypto king, eddie and jeff are in a group chat discussing crypto zoo, which starts as a copy of something else.in fact, crypto king said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars and only six months, saying the range is insane.and the one person who responded denied it, ryan kavanaugh.and not everyone was sure it would be legal.and jeff agrees and says, don't want to do anything that brings the sec eyeballs.now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though.logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins.and honestly, it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money.and this is the start of a new disaster, which takes a bit of explaining.now like i said, the team didn't want to do that.and the idea here was that doing this, the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply, which is kind of like a pre-sale, but you know, without all the sec troubles.once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying, we send the contract address to friends, family, investors, who want to be able to get in.rather than doing a pre-sale, they're going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way, but without all the legal troubles.or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day, this is where things first started to go wrong for the team.but the next day, crypto king says something odd.now jeff logan's manager replies upset.it's not cool to watch.and i think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what logan's saying is, hey, we tried to scheme this really well.and this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting.crypto king deflects the question by saying, my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and logan says, no bro, f your buyer.and look, no one's more critical of logan than me.like, yeah, it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot.because crypto king was acting very strange.logan replies, this nonchalant worries me.but truth be told, i did agree that crypto king's attitude seems strange in these texts.but it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it.and the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch.but he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens, which makes no sense.and it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like, oh, don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch.maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token.so that's why i confronted crypto king on all of this.logan didn't accuse crypto king of being a scam.well, to answer that, we have to go from june, the stealth launch date, to september 1st, the official launch date of crypto zoo.september 1st, crypto zoo dot co. now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think, well, they already have a token, right?they excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins.jake texted the group about this the next day, saying, quote, the zoo team made a major error this weekend.they chose not to communicate, meant a new token, and air drop it to whatever wallets they determined fit.this decision came from eddie and logan, and i had no partner.11,250 wallets before the air drop under 11,000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets.now who those wallets are, i have no idea.so wow, that's why crypto king accused logan of stealing from him or scamming.you betrayed your community.well, i don't know, i can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like logan stabbed him in the back.but it sounds like crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place, right?so i'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation.but it's not even true.and if that's true, there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted, right?not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold, these stealth launch tokens were different from that.and the tokens that they bought, that all of these guys bought, they could sell it basically any time because they weren't locked up, which is a massive problem.they say, quote, no selling until $200 million market cap.and by the way, this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market.no one is to sell or transfer any zoo.it's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence.and what's worse, the crypto's new team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens, which i guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing, because he then turned around and sold those tokens, right?now, i know, look, it's a lot to accuse someone of selling $6 million in a project that doesn't even work to giant scam.in fact, you know, really he might be the one who got screwed over on all of this.as long as that goes in with it, then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like i was trying to rug a project.he sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too.he tells me via text quote, i don't care if you tell people i sold a few million and leave it at that.how is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong?it might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal.and what logan did, well, that was illegal.you can say the timing was bad and it was inappropriate to sell.ascically, archival, the rest that logan did to me was ascically teed from and illegal.well, i think it's pretty wild to try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions.now, i have to tell you that like jake, i tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself.and we're just going to have to leave it there.but what i know for sure is that no one was innocent, although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about.and he never addressed the failure, except to blame his developers who weren't paid.you've got jeff, who was warned about eddie, who kept him on the team anyways.and then after they fired eddie, seems to also have failed to pay developers on time.but claims he was the guy who was scammed, which is the stupidest thing i've ever heard.it's just like a vinger's assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto game.and so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult, because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame.because if you focus on any one person, you kind of miss why this project failed.crypto zoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low.crypto zoo failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised.really, the number one problem, even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens, was that they never paid the developers on time, as boring as that is.and as a result, the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars, which is a problem, but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning, which was not a crypto project, but something different.you're not using like a project.that to me is the biggest scam in all of this.yes, it's a huge problem.people stole millions of dollars, but it's a symptom of the larger issue, which is people didn't actually care about the game or whatever you want to call it.it's what happens when you have a liar, larping as a developer, and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru, larping as a crypto king.you end up with a mess, and in my personal opinion, a fraud as well.and now that this thing blew up in their faces, these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than sbf dodges calls with me.so far, no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all.they're all hiding.pretending these victims don't even exist.rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think, i want to give them the last word.everyone's to blame.i think everyone it is to blame, including logan paul, of course, because he was the one in charge of this.and he was responsible for all of this mess.so in my opinion, if the team failed to perform, that's logan paul to blame.the communities destroyed.people is angry.that's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money.it meant a lot, not just personally because i lost quite a lot of money in my kid and also my wife were invested.so it was some kind of broken dream.so i mean my daughter even had a couple of the eggs and animals which the lost for them hurts the most because obviously she's not nice to see.to somebody to win, somebody has to lose.i got in knowing that i could lose.but i thought if i lost something it would be because i sold it the wrong time.ultimately at the end the way i see it is it was fraud.all people would stop investing more into it because people were invested.and it's sad to see that because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his youths.show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family, my whole family and my kids are affected with this situation.no, not a single word, nothing.
